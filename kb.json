        "article":"Willard Mitt Romney ( born March 12 , 1947 ) is an American businessman and politician who served as the 70th Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007 and was the Republican Party 's nominee for President of the United States in the 2012 election .\nRaised in Bloomfield Hills , Michigan by his parents George and Lenore Romney , he spent 2 \u00bd years in France as a Mormon missionary , starting in 1966 .\nHe married Ann Davies in 1969 , and they have five sons .\nBy 1971 , he had participated in the political campaigns of both parents .\nHe earned a BA from Brigham Young University in 1971 and a joint JD \u2013 MBA from Harvard University in 1975 .\nRomney became a management consultant and in 1977 secured a position at Bain & Company .\nLater serving as Bain 's chief executive officer ( CEO ) , he helped lead the company out of a financial crisis .\nIn 1984 , he co-founded and led the spin-off company Bain Capital , a highly profitable private equity investment firm that became one of the largest of its kind in the nation .\nActive in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) throughout his adult life , he served as the bishop of his ward ( head of his local congregation ) and then as stake president near Boston .\nAfter stepping down from Bain Capital and his local leadership role in the LDS Church , Romney ran as the Republican candidate in the 1994 Massachusetts election for U.S . Senate .\nAfter losing to longtime incumbent Ted Kennedy , he resumed his position at Bain Capital .\nYears later , a successful stint as President and CEO of the then-struggling Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics led to a relaunch of his political career .\nElected Governor of Massachusetts in 2002 , Romney helped develop and then signed into law the Massachusetts health care reform legislation , the first of its kind in the nation .\nIt provided near-universal health insurance access through state-level subsidies and individual mandates to purchase insurance .\nHe also presided over the elimination of a projected $ 1.2 \u2013 1.5 billion deficit through a combination of spending cuts , increased fees , and closing corporate tax loopholes .\nHe did not seek re-election in 2006 , instead focusing on his campaign for the Republican nomination in the 2008 U.S. presidential election .\nThough he won several primaries and caucuses , the eventual nominee was Senator John McCain .\nRomney 's considerable net worth , estimated in 2012 at $ 190 \u2013 250 million , helped finance his political campaigns prior to 2012 .\nRomney was the Republican Party 's nominee for President of the United States in the 2012 election .\nHe won the 2012 Republican presidential nomination , becoming the first Mormon to be the presidential nominee of a major party .\nHe was defeated by incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama in the November 2012 general election , losing the electoral college by 332 \u2013 206 .\nThe popular vote between the two major-party nominees was 51 % \u2013 47 % in Obama 's favor .\nRomney kept a low profile for a while after the election , but later became more visible politically .\nIn February 2018 , Romney announced his candidacy for the 2018 Senate election in Utah .\n= = Early life and education = =\n= = = Heritage and youth = = =\nWillard Mitt Romney was born on March 12 , 1947 , at Harper University Hospital in Detroit , Michigan , one of four children born to automobile executive George W. Romney ( 1907 \u2013 1995 ) and homemaker Lenore Romney ( n\u00e9e LaFount ; 1908 \u2013 1998 ) .\nHis mother was a native of Logan , Utah , and his father was born to American parents in a Mormon colony in Chihuahua , Mexico .\nOf primarily English descent , he also has Scottish and German ancestry .\nA fifth-generation member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) , he is a great grandson of Miles Park Romney and a great-great-grandson of Miles Romney , who converted to the faith in its first decade .\nAnother great-great-grandfather , Parley P. Pratt , helped lead the early Church .\nRomney has three older siblings , Margo , Jane , and Scott .\nMitt was the youngest by nearly six years .\nHis parents named him after a family friend , businessman J. Willard Marriott , and his father 's cousin , Milton \" Mitt \" Romney , a former quarterback for the Chicago Bears .\nRomney was referred to as \" Billy \" until kindergarten , when he expressed a preference for \" Mitt \" .\nIn 1953 , the family moved from Detroit to the affluent suburb of Bloomfield Hills and his father became the chairman and CEO of American Motors the following year and helped the company avoid bankruptcy and return to profitability .\nBy 1959 , his father had become a nationally known figure in print and on television , and Mitt idolized him .\nRomney attended public elementary schools until the seventh grade , when he enrolled as one of only a few Mormon students at Cranbrook School , a private upscale boys ' preparatory school a few miles from his home .\nMany students there came from backgrounds even more privileged than his .\nNot particularly athletic , he also did not distinguish himself academically .\nHe did participate in his father 's successful 1962 Michigan gubernatorial campaign , and later worked as an intern in the Governor 's office .\nRomney took up residence at Cranbrook when his newly elected father began spending most of his time at the state capitol .\nAt Cranbrook , Romney helped manage the ice hockey team , and he joined the pep squad .\nDuring his senior year , he joined the cross country running team .\nHe belonged to eleven school organizations and school clubs overall , including the Blue Key Club , a booster group that he had started .\nDuring his final year there , his academic record improved but fell short of excellence .\nRomney was involved in several pranks while attending Cranbrook .\nHe has since apologized for those , stating that some of the pranks may have gone too far .\nIn March of his senior year , he began dating Ann Davies ; she attended the private Kingswood School , the sister school to Cranbrook .\nThe two became informally engaged around the time of his June 1965 graduation .\n= = = University , France mission , marriage , and children : 1965 \u2013 75 = = =\nRomney attended Stanford University during the 1965 \u2013 66 academic year .\nHe was not part of the counterculture of the 1960s then taking form in the San Francisco Bay Area .\nAs opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War grew , a group staged a May 1966 sit-in at Stanford 's administration building to demonstrate against draft status tests ; Romney joined a counter-protest against that group .\nHe continued to enjoy occasional pranks .\nIn July 1966 , he began a thirty-month stint in France as a Mormon missionary , a traditional rite of passage in his family .\nHe arrived in Le Havre , where he shared cramped quarters under meager conditions .\nRules against drinking , smoking , and dating were strictly enforced .\nMost individual Mormon missionaries do not gain many converts and Romney was no exception : he later estimated ten to twenty for his entire mission .\nHe initially became demoralized and later recalled it as the only time when \" most of what I was trying to do was rejected . \"\nHe soon gained recognition within the mission for the many homes he called on and the repeat visits he was granted .\nHe was promoted to zone leader in Bordeaux in early 1968 , and soon thereafter became assistant to the mission president in Paris .\nResiding at the Mission Home for several months , he enjoyed a mansion far more comfortable than the digs he had had elsewhere in the country .\nWhen the French expressed opposition to the U.S. role in the Vietnam War , Romney debated them .\nThose who yelled at him and slammed their doors in his face merely reinforced his resolve .\nIn June 1968 , he was in southern France and driving an autombile that was hit by another vehicle , which seriously injured him and killed one of his passengers , the wife of the mission president .\nRomney then became co-president of a mission that had become demoralized and disorganized after the May 1968 general strike and student uprisings and the car accident .\nWith Romney rallying the others , the mission met its goal of 200 baptisms for the year , the most in a decade .\nBy the end of his stint in December 1968 , he was overseeing the work of 175 others .\nAs a result of his experience there , Romney developed a lifelong affection for France and its people and has also remained fluent in French .\nAt their first meeting following his return , Romney and Ann Davies reconnected and decided to get married .\nRomney began attending Brigham Young University ( BYU ) , where she had been studying .\nThe couple married on March 21 , 1969 , in a civil ceremony in Bloomfield Hills and on the following day , they flew to Utah for a Mormon wedding ceremony at the Salt Lake Temple ; Ann had converted to the faith while he was away .\nMitt had missed much of the tumultuous anti-Vietnam War movement in America while away in France .\nUpon his return , he was surprised to learn that his father had joined that same movement during his unsuccessful 1968 presidential campaign .\nGeorge was now serving in President Richard Nixon 's cabinet as United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development .\nIn a June 1970 newspaper profile of children of cabinet members , Mitt said that U.S. involvement in the war had been misguided \u2013 \" If it wasn 't a political blunder to move into Vietnam , I don 't know what is \" \u2013 but supported Nixon 's ongoing Cambodian Incursion as a sincere attempt to bring the war to a conclusion .\nDuring the U.S. military draft for the Vietnam War , Romney sought and received two 2-S student deferments , then a 4-D ministerial deferment while living in France as a Mormon missionary .\nHe later sought and received two additional student deferments .\nWhen those ran out , the result of the December 1969 draft lottery where he drew number 300 ensured he would not be drafted .\nAt culturally conservative BYU , Romney remained isolated from much of the upheaval of that era .\nHe became president of the Cougar Club booster organization and showed a new-found discipline in his studies .\nDuring his senior year , he took a leave of absence to work as driver and advance man for eventually unsuccessful Senate campaign of his mother , Lenore Romney ; together , they visited all 83 Michigan counties .\nHe earned a Bachelor of Arts in English with highest honors in 1971 , giving commencement addresses to both the College of Humanities and to the whole of BYU .\nThe Romneys ' first son , Taggart , was born in 1970 while they were undergraduates at BYU and living in a basement apartment .\nAnn subsequently gave birth to Matthew ( 1971 ) and Joshua ( 1975 ) .\nBenjamin ( 1978 ) and Craig ( 1981 ) would arrive later , after Romney had begun his career .\nMitt Romney wanted to pursue a business career , but his father advised him that a law degree would be valuable to his career even if he never practiced law .\nAs a result , he enrolled in the recently created four-year joint Juris Doctor \/ Master of Business Administration program coordinated between Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School .\nHe readily adapted to the business school 's pragmatic , data-driven case study method of teaching .\nLiving in a Belmont , Massachusetts house with Ann and their two children , his social experience differed from most of his classmates ' .\nHe was nonideological and did not involve himself in the political issues of the day .\nHe graduated in 1975 cum laude from the law school , in the top third of that class , and was named a Baker Scholar for graduating in the top five percent of his business school class .\n= = Business career = =\n= = = Management consulting = = =\nRecruited by several firms in 1975 , Romney joined the Boston Consulting Group ( BCG ) , reasoning that working as a management consultant for a variety of companies would better prepare him for a future position as a chief executive .\nPart of a 1970s wave of top graduates who chose to go into consulting rather than join a large company directly , he found his legal and business education useful in his job .\nHe applied BCG principles such as the growth-share matrix , and executives viewed him as having a bright future there .\nAt the Boston Consulting Group , he was a colleague of Benjamin Netanyahu , with whom he formed a friendship that has lasted for more than forty years .\nIn 1977 , he was hired by Bain & Company , a management consulting firm in Boston formed a few years earlier by Bill Bain and several other ex-BCG employees .\nBain himself would later say of the thirty-year-old Romney , \" He had the appearance of confidence of a guy who was maybe ten years older . \"\nUnlike other consulting firms , which issued recommendations and then departed , Bain & Company immersed itself in a clients ' businesses and worked with them until changes were implemented .\nRomney became a vice-president of the firm in 1978 , working with such clients as the Monsanto Company , Outboard Marine Corporation , Burlington Industries , and Corning Incorporated .\nWithin a few years , the firm considered him one of its best consultants .\nIn fact , clients sometimes preferred to use him rather than more-senior partners .\n= = = Minor political issues = = =\nTwo family incidents during this time later surfaced during Romney 's political campaigns .\nA state park ranger in 1981 told Romney his motorboat had an insufficiently visible license number and that he would face a $ 50 fine if he took the boat onto the lake .\nDisagreeing about the license and wanting to continue a family outing , Romney took it out anyway , saying he would pay the fine .\nThe ranger arrested him for disorderly conduct .\nThe charges were dropped several days later .\nIn 1983 , on a twelve-hour family road trip , he placed the family 's dog in a windshield-equipped carrier on the roof of their car , and then washed the car and carrier after the dog suffered a bout of diarrhea .\nThe dog incident in particular later became fodder for Romney 's critics and political opponents .\n= = = Private equity = = =\nIn 1984 , Romney left Bain & Company to co-found and lead the spin-off private equity investment firm , Bain Capital .\nHe had initially refrained from accepting Bill Bain 's offer to head the new venture , until Bain rearranged the terms in a complicated partnership structure so that there was no financial or professional risk to Romney .\nBain and Romney raised the $ 37 million in funds needed to start the new operation , which had seven employees .\nRomney held the titles of president and managing general partner .\nThough he was the sole shareholder of the firm , publications also referred to him as managing director or CEO .\nInitially , Bain Capital focused on venture capital investments .\nRomney set up a system in which any partner could veto one of these potential opportunities , and he personally saw so many weaknesses that few venture capital investments were approved in the initial two years .\nThe firm 's first significant success was a 1986 investment to help start Staples Inc . , after founder Thomas G. Stemberg convinced Romney of the market size for office supplies and Romney convinced others ; Bain Capital eventually reaped a nearly sevenfold return on its investment , and Romney sat on the Staples board of directors for over a decade .\nRomney soon switched Bain Capital 's focus from startups to the relatively new business of leveraged buyouts : buying existing companies with money mostly borrowed from banking institutions using the newly bought companies ' assets as collateral , then taking steps to improve the companies ' value , and finally selling those companies once their value peaked , usually within a few years .\nBain Capital lost money in many of its early leveraged buyouts , but then found deals that made large returns .\nThe firm invested in or acquired Accuride Corporation , Brookstone , Domino 's Pizza , Sealy Corporation , Sports Authority , and Artisan Entertainment , as well as some lesser-known companies in the industrial and medical sectors .\nMuch of the firm 's profit was earned from a relatively small number of deals ; Bain Capital 's overall success-to-failure ratio was about even .\nRomney discovered few investment opportunities himself ( and those that he did , often failed to make money for the firm ) .\nInstead , he focused on analyzing the merits of possible deals that others brought forward and on recruiting investors to participate in them once approved .\nWithin Bain Capital , Romney spread profits from deals widely within the firm to keep people motivated , often keeping less than ten percent for himself .\nData-driven , Romney often played the role of a devil 's advocate during exhaustive analysis of whether to go forward with a deal .\nHe wanted to drop a Bain Capital hedge fund that initially lost money , but other partners disagreed with him and it eventually made billions .\nHe opted out of the Artisan Entertainment deal , not wanting to profit from a studio that produced R-rated films .\nRomney served on the board of directors of Damon Corporation , a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government ; Bain Capital tripled its investment before selling off the company , and the fraud was discovered by the new owners ( Romney was never implicated ) .\nIn some cases , Romney had little involvement with a company once Bain Capital acquired it .\nBain Capital 's leveraged buyouts sometimes led to layoffs , either soon after acquisition or later after the firm had concluded its role .\nExactly how many jobs Bain Capital added compared to those lost because of these investments and buyouts is unknown , owing to a lack of records and Bain Capital 's penchant for privacy on behalf of itself and its investors .\nMaximizing the value of acquired companies and the return to Bain 's investors , not job creation , was the firm 's primary investment goal .\nBain Capital 's acquisition of Ampad exemplified a deal where it profited handsomely from early payments and management fees , even though the subject company itself later went into bankruptcy .\nDade Behring was another case where Bain Capital received an eightfold return on its investment , but the company itself was saddled with debt and laid off over a thousand employees before Bain Capital exited ( the company subsequently went into bankruptcy , with more layoffs , before recovering and prospering ) .\nReferring to the layoffs that sometimes occurred , Romney said in 2007 : \" Sometimes the medicine is a little bitter but it is necessary to save the life of the patient .\nMy job was to try and make the enterprise successful , and in my view the best security a family can have is that the business they work for is strong . \"\nIn 1990 , facing financial collapse , Bain & Company asked Romney to return .\nAnnounced as its new CEO in January 1991 , he drew a symbolic salary of one dollar ( remaining managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time ) .\nHe oversaw an effort to restructure Bain & Company 's employee stock-ownership plan and real-estate deals , while rallying the firm 's one thousand employees , imposing a new governing structure that excluded Bain and the other founding partners from control , and increasing fiscal transparency .\nHe got Bain and other initial owners who had removed excessive amounts of money from the firm to return substantial amounts , and persuaded creditors , including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , to accept less than full payment .\nWithin about a year , he had led Bain & Company to a return to profitability .\nHe turned Bain & Company over to new leadership and returned to Bain Capital in December 1992 .\nRomney took a leave of absence from Bain Capital from November 1993 to November 1994 to run for the U.S . Senate .\nDuring that time , Ampad workers went on strike and asked Romney to intervene .\nAgainst the advice of Bain Capital lawyers , Romney met the strikers , but told them he had no position of active authority in the matter .\nBy 1999 , Bain Capital was on its way towards becoming one of the foremost private equity firms in the nation , having increased its number of partners from 5 to 18 , with 115 employees and $ 4 billion under management .\nThe firm 's average annual internal rate of return on realized investments was 113 percent and its average yearly return to investors was around 50 \u2013 80 percent on their investments .\nStarting in February 1999 , Romney took a paid leave of absence from Bain Capital in order to serve as the president and CEO of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Games Organizing Committee .\nBilled in some public statements as keeping a part-time role , Romney remained the firm 's sole shareholder , managing director , CEO , and president , signing corporate and legal documents , attending to his interests within the firm , and conducting prolonged negotiations for the terms of his departure .\nHe did not involve himself in day-to-day operations of the firm or in the investment decisions of Bain Capital 's new private equity funds .\nHe retained his position on several boards of directors during this time and regularly returned to Massachusetts to attend meetings .\nIn August 2001 , Romney announced that he would not return to Bain Capital .\nHis separation from the firm concluded in early 2002 ; He transferred his ownership to other partners and negotiated an agreement that allowed him to receive a share of the profits as a retired partner in some Bain Capital entities , including buyout and investment funds .\nThe private equity business continued to thrive , earning him millions of dollars in annual income .\n= = = Personal wealth = = =\nAs a result of his business career , Romney and his wife had a net worth of between $ 190 and $ 250 million , including their retirement account , worth between $ 20 and $ 100 million .\nMost of that wealth has been held in blind trusts since 2003 , some of it offshore .\nAn additional blind trust , valued at $ 100 million in 2012 , exists in the name of their children .\nIn 2010 , Romney and his wife received about $ 22 million in income , almost all of it from investments such as dividends , capital gains , and carried interest ; and they paid about $ 3 million in federal income taxes , for an effective tax rate of 14 percent .\nFor the years 1990 \u2013 2010 , their effective federal tax rates were above 13 percent with an average rate of about 20 percent .\nRomney has tithed to the LDS Church regularly , and donated generously to LDS Church-owned BYU .\nIn 2010 , for example , he and his wife gave $ 1.5 million to the Church .\nThe Romney family 's Tyler Charitable Foundation gave out about $ 650,000 in that year , some of which went to organizations that fight diseases .\n= = Local LDS Church leadership = =\nDuring his business career , Romney held several positions in the local lay clergy .\nIn 1977 , he became a counselor to the president of the Boston Stake .\nHe served as bishop of the ward ( ecclesiastical and administrative head of his congregation ) at Belmont , Massachusetts , from 1981 to 1986 .\nAs such , in addition to home teaching , he also formulated Sunday services and classes using LDS scriptures to guide the congregation .\nAfter the destruction of the Belmont meetinghouse by a fire of suspicious origins in 1984 , he forged links with other religious institutions , allowing the congregation to rotate its meetings to other houses of worship during the reconstruction of the Belmont building .\nFrom 1986 to 1994 , Romney presided over the Boston Stake , which included more than a dozen wards in eastern Massachusetts and almost 4,000 church members .\nHe organized a team to handle financial and management issues , sought to counter anti-Mormon sentiments , and tried to solve social problems among poor Southeast Asian converts .\nAn unpaid position , his local church leadership often took 30 or more hours a week of his time , and he became known for his considerable energy in the role .\nHe also earned a reputation for avoiding any overnight travel that might interfere with his church responsibilities .\nRomney took a hands-on role in the Belmont Stake 's matters , helping in domestic maintenance efforts , visiting the sick , and counseling burdened church members .\nA number of local church members later credited him with turning their lives around or helping them through difficult times .\nOthers , rankled by his leadership style , desired a more consensus-based approach .\nRomney tried to balance the conservative directives from church leadership in Utah with the desire of some Massachusetts members to have a more flexible application of religious doctrine .\nHe agreed with some requests from a liberal women 's group that published Exponent II calling for changes in the way the church dealt with women , but he clashed with women whom he felt were departing too much from doctrine .\nIn particular , he counseled women not to have abortions except in the rare cases allowed by LDS doctrine and encouraged unmarried women facing unplanned pregnancies to give up their babies for adoption .\nRomney later said that the years spent as an LDS minister gave him direct exposure to people struggling financially and empathy for those with family problems .\n= = 1994 U.S . Senatorial campaign = =\nFor much of his business career , Romney did not take public , political stances .\nHe had kept abreast of national politics since college , though , and the circumstances of his father 's presidential campaign loss had irked him for decades .\nHe registered as an Independent and voted in the 1992 presidential primaries for the Democratic former senator from Massachusetts , Paul Tsongas .\nBy 1993 , Romney had begun thinking about entering politics , partly based upon Ann 's urging and partly to follow in his father 's footsteps .\nHe decided to challenge incumbent Democratic U.S .\nSenator Ted Kennedy , who was seeking re-election for the sixth time .\nPolitical pundits viewed Kennedy as vulnerable that year \u2013 in part because of the unpopularity of the Democratic Congress as a whole , and in part because this was Kennedy 's first election since the William Kennedy Smith trial in Florida , in which the senator 's reputation for character had suffered .\nRomney changed his affiliation to Republican in October 1993 and formally announced his candidacy in February 1994 .\nIn addition to his leave from Bain Capital , Romney also stepped down from his church leadership role in 1994 .\nRadio personality Janet Jeghelian took an early lead in polls among candidates for the Republican nomination for the Senate seat , but Romney proved the most effective fundraiser .\nHe won 68 percent of the vote at the May 1994 Massachusetts Republican Party convention ; businessman John Lakian finished a distant second , eliminating Jeghelian .\nRomney defeated Lakian in the September 1994 primary with more than 80 percent of the vote .\nIn the general election , Kennedy faced the first serious re-election challenge of his career .\nThe younger , telegenic , and well-funded Romney ran as a businessman who stated he had created ten thousand jobs and as a Washington outsider with a solid family image and moderate stances on social issues .\nWhen Kennedy tried to tie Romney 's policies to those of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush , Romney responded , \" Look , I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush .\nI 'm not trying to take us back to Reagan-Bush . \"\nRomney stated , \" Ultimately , this is a campaign about change . \"\nRomney 's campaign was effective in portraying Kennedy as soft on crime , but had trouble establishing its own consistent positions .\nBy mid-September 1994 , polls showed the race to be about even .\nKennedy responded with a series of ads that focused on Romney 's seemingly shifting political views on issues such as abortion ; Romney responded by stating , \" I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country . \"\nOther Kennedy ads centered on layoffs of workers at the Ampad plant owned by Romney 's Bain Capital .\nThe latter was effective in blunting Romney 's momentum .\nKennedy and Romney held a widely watched late-October debate that had no clear winner , but by then , Kennedy had pulled ahead in polls and stayed ahead afterward .\nRomney spent $ 3 million of his own money in the race and more than $ 7 million overall .\nIn the November general election , despite a disastrous showing for Democrats nationwide , Kennedy won the election with 58 percent of the vote to Romney 's 41 percent , the smallest margin in any of Kennedy 's re-election campaigns for the Senate .\nThe day after the election , Romney returned to Bain Capital , but the loss had a lasting effect ; he told his brother , \" I never want to run for something again unless I can win . \"\nWhen his father died in 1995 , Mitt donated his inheritance to BYU 's George W. Romney Institute of Public Management .\nHe also became vice-chair of the Board of the Points of Light Foundation , which had embraced his father 's National Volunteer Center .\nRomney felt restless as the decade neared a close ; the goal of simply making more money held little attraction for him .\nAlthough no longer in a local leadership position in his church , he still taught Sunday School .\nDuring the long and controversial approval and construction process for the $ 30 million Mormon temple in Belmont , he feared that , as a political figure who had opposed Kennedy , he would become a focal point for opposition to the structure .\nHe thus kept to a limited , behind-the-scenes role in attempts to ease tensions between the church and local residents .\n= = 2002 Winter Olympics = =\nIn 1998 , Ann Romney learned that she had multiple sclerosis ; Mitt described watching her fail a series of neurological tests as the worst day of his life .\nAfter experiencing two years of severe difficulties with the disease , she found \u2013 while living in Park City , Utah , where the couple had built a vacation home \u2013 a combination of mainstream , alternative , and equestrian therapies that enabled her to lead a lifestyle mostly without limitations .\nWhen her husband received a job offer to take over the troubled organization responsible for the 2002 Winter Olympics and Paralympics , to be held in Salt Lake City in Utah , she urged him to accept it ; eager for a new challenge , as well as another chance to prove himself in public life , he did .\nOn February 11 , 1999 , the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002 hired Romney as its president and CEO .\nBefore Romney took over , the event was $ 379 million short of its revenue goals .\nOfficials had made plans to scale back the Games to compensate for the fiscal crisis , and there were fears it might be moved away entirely .\nIn addition , the image of the Games had been damaged by allegations of bribery against top officials including prior committee president and CEO Frank Joklik .\nThe Salt Lake Organizing Committee forced Joklik and committee vice president Dave Johnson to resign .\nUtah power brokers , including Governor Mike Leavitt , searched for someone with a scandal-free reputation to take charge of the Olympics .\nThey chose Romney based on his business and legal expertise as well as his connections to both the LDS Church and the state .\nThe appointment faced some initial criticism from both non-Mormons and Mormons that it represented cronyism and made the Games seem too Mormon-dominated .\nRomney donated to charity the $ 1.4 million in salary and severance payments he received for his three years as president and CEO , and also contributed $ 1 million to the Olympics .\nRomney restructured the organization 's leadership and policies .\nHe reduced budgets and boosted fundraising , alleviating the concerns of corporate sponsors while recruiting new ones .\nRomney worked to ensure the safety of the Games following the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks by coordinating a $ 300 million security budget .\nHe oversaw a $ 1.32 billion total budget , 700 employees , and 26,000 volunteers .\nThe federal government provided approximately $ 400 million to $ 600 million of that budget , much of it a result of Romney 's having aggressively lobbied Congress and federal agencies .\nIt was a record level of federal funding for the staging of a U.S . Olympics .\nAn additional $ 1.1 billion of indirect federal funding came to the state in the form of highway and transit projects .\nRomney emerged as the local public face of the Olympic effort , appearing in photographs , in news stories , on collectible Olympics pins depicting Romney wrapped by an American flag , and on buttons carrying phrases like \" Hey , Mitt , we love you ! \"\nRobert H. Garff , the chair of the organizing committee , later said \" It was obvious that he had an agenda larger than just the Olympics , \" and that Romney wanted to use the Olympics to propel himself into the national spotlight and a political career .\nGarff believed the initial budget situation was not as bad as Romney portrayed , given there were still three years to reorganize .\nUtah Senator Bob Bennett said that much of the needed federal money was already in place .\nAn analysis by The Boston Globe later stated that the committee had nearly $ 1 billion in committed revenues at that time .\nOlympics critic Steve Pace , who led Utahns for Responsible Public Spending , thought Romney exaggerated the initial fiscal state to lay the groundwork for a well-publicized rescue .\nKenneth Bullock , another board member of the organizing committee and also head of the Utah League of Cities and Towns , often clashed with Romney at the time , and later said that Romney deserved some credit for the turnaround but not as much as he claimed .\nBullock said : \" He tried very hard to build an image of himself as a savior , the great white hope .\nHe was very good at characterizing and castigating people and putting himself on a pedestal . \"\nDespite the initial fiscal shortfall , the Games ended up with a surplus of $ 100 million .\nPresident George W. Bush praised Romney 's efforts and 87 percent of Utahns approved of his performance as Olympics head .\nIt solidified his reputation as a \" turnaround artist \" , and Harvard Business School taught a case study based around his actions .\nU.S . Olympic Committee head William Hybl credited Romney with an extraordinary effort in overcoming a difficult time for the Olympics , culminating in \" the greatest Winter Games I have ever seen \" .\nRomney wrote a book about his experience titled Turnaround : Crisis , Leadership , and the Olympic Games , published in 2004 .\nThe role gave Romney experience in dealing with federal , state , and local entities , a public persona he had previously lacked , and the chance to relaunch his political aspirations .\n= = Governor of Massachusetts = =\n= = = 2002 Gubernatorial campaign = = =\nIn 2002 , plagued by political missteps and personal scandals , the administration of Republican Acting Governor of Massachusetts Jane Swift appeared vulnerable , and many Republicans viewed her as unable to win a general election .\nProminent party figures \u2013 as well as the White House \u2013 wanted Romney to run for governor and the opportunity appealed to him for reasons including its national visibility .\nA poll by the Boston Herald showed Republicans favoring Romney over Swift by more than 50 percentage points .\nOn March 19 , 2002 , Swift announced she would not seek her party 's nomination , and hours later Romney declared his candidacy , for which he would face no opposition in the primary .\nIn June 2002 , the Massachusetts Democratic Party challenged Romney 's eligibility to run for governor , noting that state law required seven years ' consecutive residence and that Romney had filed his state tax returns as a Utah resident in 1999 and 2000 .\nIn response , the bipartisan Massachusetts State Ballot Law Commission unanimously ruled that he had maintained sufficient financial and personal ties to Massachusetts and was , therefore , an eligible candidate .\nRomney again ran as a political outsider .\nHe played down his party affiliation , saying he was \" not a partisan Republican \" but rather a \" moderate \" with \" progressive \" views .\nHe stated that he would observe a moratorium on changes to the state 's laws on abortion , but reiterated that he would \" preserve and protect a woman 's right to choose \" and that his position was \" unequivocal \" .\nHe touted his private sector experience as qualifying him for addressing the state 's fiscal problems and stressed his ability to obtain federal funds for the state , offering his Olympics record as evidence .\nHe proposed to reorganize the state government while eliminating waste , fraud , and mismanagement .\nThe campaign innovatively utilized microtargeting techniques , identifying like-minded groups of voters and reaching them with narrowly tailored messaging .\nIn an attempt to overcome the image that had damaged him in the 1994 Senate race \u2013 that of a wealthy corporate buyout specialist out of touch with the needs of regular people \u2013 the campaign staged a series of \" work days \" , in which Romney performed blue-collar jobs such as herding cows and baling hay , unloading a fishing boat , and hauling garbage .\nTelevision ads highlighting the effort , as well as one portraying his family in gushing terms and showing him shirtless , received a poor public response and were a factor in his Democratic opponent , Massachusetts State Treasurer Shannon O 'Brien , leading in the polls as late as mid-October .\nHe responded with ads that accused O 'Brien of being a failed watchdog for state pension fund losses in the stock market and that associated her husband , a former lobbyist , with the Enron scandal .\nThese were effective in capturing independent voters .\nO 'Brien said that Romney 's budget plans were unrealistic ; the two also differed on capital punishment and bilingual education , with Romney supporting the former and opposing the latter .\nDuring the election , Romney contributed more than $ 6 million \u2013 a state record at the time \u2013 to the nearly $ 10 million raised for his campaign overall .\nOn November 5 , 2002 , he won the governorship , earning 50 percent of the vote to O 'Brien 's 45 percent .\n= = = Tenure , 2003 \u2013 07 = = =\nThe swearing in of Romney as the 70th governor of Massachusetts took place on January 2 , 2003 .\nHe faced a Massachusetts state legislature with large Democratic majorities in both houses , and had picked his cabinet and advisors based more on managerial abilities than partisan affiliation .\nHe declined a governor 's salary of $ 135,000 during his term .\nUpon entering office in the middle of a fiscal year , he faced an immediate $ 650 million shortfall and a projected $ 3 billion deficit for the next year .\nUnexpected revenue of $ 1.0 \u2013 1.3 billion from a previously enacted capital gains tax increase and $ 500 million in new federal grants decreased the deficit to $ 1.2 \u2013 1.5 billion .\nThrough a combination of spending cuts , increased fees , and removal of corporate tax loopholes , the state achieved surpluses of around $ 600 \u2013 700 million during Romney 's last two full fiscal years in office , although it began running deficits again after that .\nRomney supported raising various fees , including those for drivers ' licenses and gun licenses , to raise more than $ 300 million .\nHe increased a special gasoline retailer fee by two cents per gallon , generating about $ 60 million per year in additional revenue .\nOpponents said the reliance on fees sometimes imposed a hardship on those who could least afford them .\nRomney also closed tax loopholes that brought in another $ 181 million from businesses over the next two years and over $ 300 million for his term .\nHe did so in the face of conservative and corporate critics who viewed these actions as tax increases .\nThe state legislature , with the governor 's support , cut spending by $ 1.6 billion , including $ 700 million in reductions in state aid to cities and towns .\nThe cuts also included a $ 140 million reduction in state funding for higher education , which led state-run colleges and universities to increase fees by 63 percent over four years .\nRomney sought additional cuts in his last year as governor by vetoing nearly 250 items in the state budget ; a heavily Democratic legislature overrode all the vetoes .\nThe cuts in state spending put added pressure on localities to reduce services or raise property taxes , and the share of town and city revenues coming from property taxes rose from 49 to 53 percent .\nThe combined state and local tax burden in Massachusetts increased during Romney 's governorship .\nHe did propose a reduction in the state income tax rate that the legislature rejected .\nRomney sought to bring near-universal health insurance coverage to the state .\nThis came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him at the start of his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people .\nAnother factor was that the federal government , owing to the rules of Medicaid funding , threatened to cut $ 385 million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services .\nAlthough the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign , Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care , the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor .\nDetermined that a new Massachusetts health insurance measure not raise taxes or resemble the previous decade 's failed \" Hillarycare \" proposal at the federal level , Romney formed a team of consultants from diverse political backgrounds to apply those principles .\nBeginning in late 2004 , they devised a set of proposals that were more ambitious than an incremental one from the Massachusetts Senate and more acceptable to him than one from the Massachusetts House of Representatives that incorporated a new payroll tax .\nIn particular , Romney pushed for incorporating an individual mandate at the state level .\nPast rival Ted Kennedy , who had made universal health coverage his life 's work and who , over time , had developed a warm relationship with Romney , gave the plan a positive reception , which encouraged Democratic legislators to cooperate .\nThe effort eventually gained the support of all major stakeholders within the state , and Romney helped break a logjam between rival Democratic leaders in the legislature .\nOn April 12 , 2006 , the governor signed the resulting Massachusetts health reform law , commonly called \" Romneycare \" , which requires nearly all Massachusetts residents to buy health insurance coverage or face escalating tax penalties , such as the loss of their personal income tax exemption .\nThe bill also established means-tested state subsidies for people who lacked adequate employer insurance and whose income was below a threshold , using funds that had covered the health costs of the uninsured .\nHe vetoed eight sections of the health care legislation , including a controversial $ 295-per-employee assessment on businesses that do not offer health insurance and provisions guaranteeing dental benefits to Medicaid recipients .\nThe legislature overrode all eight vetoes , but the governor 's office said the differences were not essential .\nThe law was the first of its kind in the nation and became the signature achievement of Romney 's term in office .\nAt the beginning of his governorship , Romney opposed same-sex marriage and civil unions , but advocated tolerance and supported some domestic partnership benefits .\nA November 2003 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision required the state to recognize same-sex marriages ( Goodridge v. Department of Public Health ) .\nRomney reluctantly backed a state constitutional amendment in February 2004 that would have banned those marriages but still allowed civil unions , viewing it as the only feasible way to accomplish the former .\nIn May 2004 , in compliance with the court decision , the governor instructed town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples .\nHowever , citing a 1913 law that barred out-of-state residents from getting married in Massachusetts if their union would be illegal in their home state , he said no marriage licenses were to be issued to those people not planning to move to Massachusetts .\nIn June 2005 , Romney abandoned his support for the compromise amendment , stating that it confused voters who opposed both same-sex marriage and civil unions .\nInstead , he endorsed a ballot initiative led by the Coalition for Marriage and Family ( an alliance of socially conservative organizations ) that would have banned same-sex marriage and made no provisions for civil unions .\nIn 2004 and 2006 , he urged the U.S . Senate to vote in favor of the Federal Marriage Amendment .\nIn 2005 , Romney revealed a change of view regarding abortion , moving from the pro-choice positions expressed during his 1994 and 2002 campaigns to a pro-life one in opposition to Roe v. Wade .\nRomney attributed his conversion to an interaction with Harvard University biologist Douglas Melton , an expert on embryonic stem cell biology , although Melton vehemently disputed Romney 's recollection of their conversation .\nRomney subsequently vetoed a bill on pro-life grounds that expanded access to emergency contraception in hospitals and pharmacies ( the legislature overrode the veto ) .\nHe also amended his position on embryonic stem cell research itself .\nRomney used a bully pulpit approach towards promoting his agenda , staging well-organized media events to appeal directly to the public rather than pushing his proposals in behind-doors sessions with the state legislature .\nHe dealt with a public crisis of confidence in Boston 's Big Dig project \u2013 that followed a fatal ceiling collapse in 2006 \u2013 by wresting control of the project from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority .\nAfter two years of negotiating the state 's participation in the landmark Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that instituted a cap-and-trade arrangement for power plant emissions in the Northeast , Romney pulled Massachusetts out of the initiative shortly before its signing in December 2005 , citing a lack of cost limits for industry .\nDuring 2004 , Romney spent considerable effort trying to bolster the state Republican Party , but it failed to gain any seats in the state legislative elections that year .\nGiven a prime-time appearance at the 2004 Republican National Convention , political figures began discussing him as a potential 2008 presidential candidate .\nMidway through his term , Romney decided that he wanted to stage a full-time run for president , and on December 14 , 2005 , announced that he would not seek re-election for a second term .\nAs chair of the Republican Governors Association , Romney traveled around the country , meeting prominent Republicans and building a national political network ; he spent all , or parts of , more than 200 days out of state during 2006 , preparing for his run .\nThe Governor had a 61 percent job approval rating in public polls after his initial fiscal actions in 2003 , although his approval rating subsequently declined , driven in part by his frequent out-of-state travel .\nRomney 's approval rating stood at 34 percent in November 2006 , ranking 48th of the 50 U.S . governors .\nDissatisfaction with Romney 's administration and the weak condition of the Republican state party were among several factors contributing to Democrat Deval Patrick 's 20-point win over Republican Kerry Healey , Romney 's lieutenant governor , in the 2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial election .\nRomney filed to register a presidential campaign committee with the Federal Election Commission on his penultimate day in office as governor .\nHis term ended January 4 , 2007 .\n= = 2008 presidential campaign = =\nRomney formally announced his candidacy for the 2008 Republican nomination for president on February 13 , 2007 , in Dearborn , Michigan .\nAgain casting himself as a political outsider , his speech frequently invoked his father and his family , and stressed experiences in the private , public , and voluntary sectors that had brought him to this point .\nThe campaign emphasized Romney 's highly profitable career in the business world and his stewardship of the Olympics .\nHe also had political experience as a governor , together with a political pedigree courtesy of his father ( as well as many biographical parallels with him ) .\nAnn Romney , who had become an advocate for those with multiple sclerosis , was in remission and would be an active participant in his campaign , helping to soften his political personality .\nMedia stories referred to the Romney as handsome .\nMoreover , a number of commentators noted that with his square jaw and ample hair graying at the temples , he physically matched one of the common images of what a president should look like .\nRomney 's liabilities included having run for senator and serving as governor in one of the nation 's most liberal states and having taken positions in opposition to the party 's conservative base during that time .\nLate during his term as governor , he had shifted positions and emphases to better align with traditional conservatives on social issues .\nSkeptics , including some Republicans , charged Romney with opportunism and a lack of core principles .\nAs a Mormon , he faced suspicion and skepticism by some in the Evangelical portion of the party .\nFor his campaign , Romney assembled a veteran group of Republican staffers , consultants , and pollsters .\nHe was little-known nationally , though , and stayed around the 10 percent support range in Republican preference polls for the first half of 2007 .\nHe proved the most effective fundraiser of any of the Republican candidates and also partly financed his campaign with his own personal fortune .\nThese resources , combined with the mid-year near-collapse of nominal front-runner John McCain 's campaign , made Romney a threat to win the nomination and the focus of the other candidates ' attacks .\nRomney 's staff suffered from internal strife ; the candidate himself was at times indecisive , often asking for more data before making a decision .\nDuring all of his political campaigns , Romney has avoided speaking publicly about Mormon doctrines , referring to the U.S . Constitution 's prohibition of religious tests for public office .\nBut persistent questions about the role of religion in Romney 's life , as well as Southern Baptist minister and former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee 's rise in the polls based upon an explicitly Christian-themed campaign , led to the December 6 , 2007 , \" Faith in America \" speech .\nIn the speech Romney declared , \" I believe in my Mormon faith and endeavor to live by it .\nMy faith is the faith of my fathers .\nI will be true to them and to my beliefs . \"\nRomney added that he should neither be elected nor rejected based upon his religion , and echoed Senator John F. Kennedy 's famous speech during his 1960 presidential campaign in saying , \" I will put no doctrine of any church above the plain duties of the office and the sovereign authority of the law . \"\nInstead of discussing the specific tenets of his faith , he said he would be informed by it , stating : \" Freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom .\nFreedom and religion endure together , or perish alone . \"\nAcademics would later study the role religion had played in the campaign .\nThe campaign 's strategy called for winning the initial two contests \u2013 the January 3 , 2008 , Iowa Republican caucuses and the adjacent-to-his-home-state January 8 New Hampshire primary \u2013 and propelling Romney nationally .\nHowever , he took second place in both , losing Iowa to a vastly outspent Huckabee who received more than twice the evangelical Christian votes , and losing New Hampshire to the resurgent McCain .\nHuckabee and McCain criticized Romney 's image as a flip flopper and this label would stick to Romney through the campaign ( one that Romney rejected as unfair and inaccurate , except for his acknowledged change of mind on abortion ) .\nRomney seemed to approach the campaign as a management consulting exercise , and showed a lack of personal warmth and political feel ; journalist Evan Thomas wrote that Romney \" came off as a phony , even when he was perfectly sincere . \"\nThe fervor with which Romney adopted his new stances and attitudes contributed to the perception of inauthenticity that hampered the campaign .\nRomney 's staff would conclude that competing as a candidate of social conservatism and ideological purity rather than of pragmatic competence had been a mistake .\nA win by McCain over Huckabee in South Carolina , and by Romney over McCain in childhood-home Michigan , set up a pivotal battle in the Florida primary .\nRomney campaigned intensively on economic issues and the burgeoning subprime mortgage crisis , while McCain attacked Romney regarding Iraq policy and benefited from endorsements from Florida officeholders .\nMcCain won a 5 percentage point victory on January 29 .\nAlthough many Republican officials were now lining up behind McCain , Romney persisted through the nationwide Super Tuesday contests on February 5 .\nThere he won primaries or caucuses in several states , but McCain won in more and in larger-population ones .\nTrailing McCain in delegates by a more than two-to-one margin , Romney announced the end of his campaign on February 7 .\nAltogether , Romney had won 11 primaries and caucuses , receiving about 4.7 million votes and garnering about 280 delegates .\nHe spent $ 110 million during the campaign , including $ 45 million of his own money .\nRomney endorsed McCain for president a week later , and McCain had Romney on a short list for vice presidential running mate , where his business experience would have balanced one of McCain 's weaknesses .\nMcCain , behind in the polls , opted instead for a high-risk , high-reward \" game changer \" , selecting Alaska Governor Sarah Palin .\nMcCain lost the election to Democratic Senator Barack Obama .\n= = Activity between presidential campaigns = =\nRomney supported the Bush administration 's Troubled Asset Relief Program in response to the late-2000s financial crisis , later saying that it prevented the U.S. financial system from collapsing .\nDuring the U.S. automotive industry crisis of 2008 \u2013 10 , he opposed a bailout of the industry in the form of direct government intervention , and argued that a managed bankruptcy of struggling automobile companies should instead be accompanied by federal guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing from the private sector .\nFollowing the 2008 election , Romney laid the groundwork for a likely 2012 presidential campaign by using his Free and Strong America political action committee ( PAC ) to raise money for other Republican candidates and pay his existing political staff 's salaries and consulting fees .\nA network of former staff and supporters around the nation were eager for him to run again .\nHe continued to give speeches and raise funds for Republicans , but fearing overexposure , turned down many potential media appearances .\nHe also spoke before business , educational , and motivational groups .\nFrom 2009 to 2011 , he served on the board of directors of Marriott International , founded by his namesake J. Willard Marriott .\nHe had previously served on it from 1993 to 2002 .\nIn 2009 , the Romneys sold their primary residence in Belmont and their ski chalet in Utah , leaving them an estate along Lake Winnipesaukee in Wolfeboro , New Hampshire , and an oceanfront home in the La Jolla district of San Diego , California , which they had purchased the year before .\nThe La Jolla home proved beneficial in location and climate for Ann Romney 's multiple sclerosis therapies and for recovering from her late 2008 diagnosis of mammary ductal carcinoma in situ and subsequent lumpectomy .\nBoth it and the New Hampshire location were near some of their grandchildren .\nRomney maintained his voting registration in Massachusetts , however , and bought a smaller condominium in Belmont during 2010 .\nIn February 2010 , Romney had a minor altercation with LMFAO member Skyler Gordy , known as Sky Blu , on an airplane flight .\nRomney released his book , No Apology : The Case for American Greatness , in March 2010 , and undertook an 18-state book tour to promote the work .\nIn the book , Romney writes of his belief in American exceptionalism , and presents his economic and geopolitical views rather than anecdotes about his personal or political life .\nIt debuted atop The New York Times Best Seller list .\nRomney donated his earnings from the book to charity .\nImmediately following the March 2010 passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , Romney attacked the landmark legislation as \" an unconscionable abuse of power \" and said the act should be repealed .\nThe antipathy Republicans felt for it created a potential problem for the former governor , since the new federal law was in many ways similar to the Massachusetts health care reform passed during Romney 's gubernatorial tenure ; as one Associated Press article stated , \" Obamacare ... looks a lot like Romneycare . \"\nWhile acknowledging that his plan was an imperfect work in progress , Romney did not back away from it .\nHe defended the state-level health insurance mandate that underpinned it , calling the bill the right answer to Massachusetts ' problems at the time .\nIn nationwide opinion polling for the 2012 Republican Presidential primaries , Romney led or placed in the top three with Palin and Huckabee .\nA January 2010 National Journal survey of political insiders found that a majority of Republican insiders and a plurality of Democratic insiders predicted Romney would be the party 's 2012 nominee .\nRomney campaigned heavily for Republican candidates in the 2010 midterm elections , raising more money than the other prospective 2012 Republican presidential candidates .\nBeginning in early 2011 , Romney presented a more relaxed visual image , including more casual attire .\n= = 2012 presidential campaign = =\nOn April 11 , 2011 , Romney announced , via a video taped outdoors at the University of New Hampshire , that he had formed an exploratory committee for a run for the Republican presidential nomination .\nQuinnipiac University political science professor Scott McLean stated , \" We all knew that he was going to run .\nHe 's really been running for president ever since the day after the 2008 election . \"\nRomney stood to benefit from the Republican electorate 's tendency to nominate candidates who had previously run for president , and thus appeared to be next in line to be chosen .\nThe early stages of the race found him as the apparent front-runner in a weak field , especially in terms of fundraising prowess and organization .\nPerhaps his greatest hurdle in gaining the Republican nomination was party opposition to the Massachusetts health care reform law that he had shepherded five years earlier .\nAs many potential Republican candidates with star power and fundraising ability decided not to run ( including Mike Pence , John Thune , Haley Barbour , Mike Huckabee , and Mitch Daniels ) , Republican party figures searched for plausible alternatives to Romney .\nOn June 2 , 2011 , Romney formally announced the start of his campaign .\nSpeaking on a farm in Stratham , New Hampshire , he focused on the economy and criticized President Obama 's handling of it .\nHe said , \" In the campaign to come , the American ideals of economic freedom and opportunity need a clear and unapologetic defense , and I intend to make it \u2013 because I have lived it . \"\nRomney raised $ 56 million during 2011 , more than double the amount raised by any of his Republican opponents , and refrained from spending his own money on the campaign .\nHe initially pursued a low-key , low-profile strategy .\nMichele Bachmann staged a brief surge in polls , which preceded a poll surge in September 2011 by Rick Perry who had entered the race the month before .\nPerry and Romney exchanged sharp criticisms of each other during a series of debates among the Republican candidates .\nThe October 2011 decisions of Chris Christie and Sarah Palin not to run effectively settled the field of candidates .\nPerry faded after poor performances in those debates , while Herman Cain 's ' long-shot ' bid gained popularity until allegations of sexual misconduct derailed it .\nRomney continued to seek support from a wary Republican electorate ; at this point in the race , his poll numbers were relatively flat and at a historically low level for a Republican frontrunner .\nAfter the charges of flip-flopping that marked his 2008 campaign began to accumulate again , Romney declared in November 2011 : \" I 've been as consistent as human beings can be . \"\nIn the final month before voting began , Newt Gingrich experienced a significant surge \u2013 taking a solid lead in national polls and most of the early caucus and primary states \u2013 before settling back into parity or worse with Romney following a barrage of negative ads from Restore Our Future , a pro-Romney Super PAC .\nIn the initial contest , the 2012 Iowa caucuses of January 3 , election officials announced Romney as ahead with 25 percent of the vote , edging out a late-gaining Rick Santorum by eight votes ( an also-strong Ron Paul finished third ) .\nSixteen days later , however , they certified Santorum as the winner by a 34-vote margin .\nA week after the Iowa caucuses , Romney earned a decisive win in the New Hampshire primary with a total of 39 percent of the vote ; Paul finished second and Jon Huntsman , Jr .\nthird .\nIn the run-up to the South Carolina Republican primary , Gingrich launched ads criticizing Romney for causing job losses while at Bain Capital , Perry referred to Romney 's role there as \" vulture capitalism \" , and Sarah Palin pressed Romney to prove his claim that he created 100,000 jobs during that time .\nMany conservatives rallied in defense of Romney , rejecting what they inferred as criticism of free-market capitalism .\nDuring two debates in the state , Romney fumbled questions about releasing his income tax returns , while Gingrich gained support with audience-rousing attacks on the debate moderators .\nRomney 's double-digit lead in state polls evaporated ; he lost to Gingrich by 13 points in the January 21 primary .\nCombined with the delayed loss in Iowa , Romney 's admitted poor week represented a lost chance to end the race early , and he quickly decided to release two years of his tax returns .\nThe race turned to the Florida Republican primary , where in debates , appearances , and advertisements , Romney launched a sustained barrage against Gingrich 's past record and associations and current electability .\nRomney enjoyed a large spending advantage from both his campaign and his aligned Super PAC , and after a record-breaking rate of negative ads from both sides , Romney won Florida on January 31 , gaining 46 percent of the vote to Gingrich 's 32 percent .\nSeveral caucuses and primaries took place during February , and Santorum won three in a single night early in the month , propelling him into the lead in national and some state polls and positioning him as Romney 's chief rival .\nDays later , Romney told the Conservative Political Action Conference that he had been a \" severely conservative governor \" ( while during his term in 2005 he had maintained that his positions were moderate and characterized reports that he was shifting to the right to attract conservative votes a media distortion ) .\nRomney won the other five February contests , including a closely fought one in his home state of Michigan at the end of the month .\nIn the Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses of March 6 , Romney won six of ten contests , including a narrow victory in Ohio over a vastly outspent Santorum .\nAlthough his victories were not enough to end the race , they were enough to establish a two-to-one delegate lead over Santorum .\nRomney maintained his delegate margin through subsequent contests , and Santorum suspended his campaign on April 10 .\nFollowing a sweep of five more contests on April 24 , the Republican National Committee put its resources to work for Romney as the party 's presumptive nominee .\nRomney clinched a majority of the delegates with a win in the Texas primary on May 29 .\nPolls consistently indicated a tight race for the November general election .\nNegative ads from both sides dominated the campaign , with Obama 's proclaiming that Romney shipped jobs overseas while at Bain Capital and kept money in offshore tax havens and Swiss bank accounts .\nA related issue dealt with Romney 's purported responsibility for actions at Bain Capital after taking the Olympics post .\nRomney faced demands from Democrats to release additional years of his tax returns , an action a number of Republicans also felt would be wise ; after being adamant that he would not do that , he released summaries of them in late September .\nDuring May and June , the Obama campaign spent heavily and was able to paint a negative image of Romney in voters ' minds before the Romney campaign could construct a positive one .\nIn July 2012 , Romney visited the United Kingdom , Israel , and Poland , meeting leaders in an effort to raise his credibility as a world statesman .\nComments Romney made about the readiness of the 2012 Summer Olympics were perceived as undiplomatic by the British press .\nIsraeli Prime Minister ( and former BCG colleague ) Benjamin Netanyahu , embraced Romney , though some Palestinians criticized him for suggesting that Israel 's culture led to their greater economic success .\nOn August 11 , 2012 , the Romney campaign announced the selection of Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his vice-presidential running mate .\nOn August 28 , 2012 , the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa , Florida , officially nominated Romney as their candidate for the presidency .\nRomney became the first Mormon to be a major-party presidential nominee .\nIn mid-September , a video surfaced of Romney speaking before a group of supporters in which he stated that 47 percent of the nation pays no income tax , are dependent on the federal government , see themselves as victims , and will support President Obama unconditionally .\nRomney went on to say : \" And so my job is not to worry about those people .\nI 'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives . \"\nAfter facing criticism about the tone and accuracy of these comments , he at first characterized them as \" inelegantly stated \" , then a couple of weeks later commented : \" I said something that 's just completely wrong . \"\nExit polls published following the election showed that voters never saw Romney as someone who cared about people like them .\nThe first of three 2012 presidential election debates took place on October 3 , in Denver .\nMedia figures and political analysts widely viewed Romney as having delivered a stronger and more focused presentation than did President Obama .\nThat initial debate overshadowed Obama 's improved presentation in the last two debates later in October , and Romney maintained a small advantage in the debates when seen as a whole .\nThe election took place on November 6 , and Obama was projected the winner at about 11 : 14 pm Eastern Standard Time .\nRomney garnered 206 electoral college votes to Obama 's 332 , losing all but one of nine battleground states , and 47 percent of the nationwide popular vote to Obama 's 51 percent .\nMedia accounts described Romney as \" shellshocked \" by the result .\nHe and his senior campaign staff had disbelieved public polls showing Obama narrowly ahead , and had thought they were going to win until the vote tallies began to be reported on the evening of the election .\nBut Romney 's get out the vote operation had been inferior to Obama 's , both in person-to-person organization and in voter modeling and outreach technology ( the latter exemplified by the failure of the Project Orca application ) .\nIn his concession speech to his supporters , he said , \" Like so many of you , Paul and I have left everything on the field .\nWe have given our all to this campaign .\nI so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead this country in a different direction , but the nation chose another leader . \"\nReflecting on his defeat during a conference call to hundreds of fundraisers and donors a week after the election , Romney attributed the outcome to Obama 's having secured the votes of specific interest groups , including African Americans , Hispanic Americans , young people , and women , by offering them what Romney called \" extraordinary financial gifts . \"\nThe remark drew heavy criticism from prominent members of the Republican party .\n= = = Political positions = = =\nIn addition to calling for cuts in federal government spending to help reduce the national debt , Romney proposed measures intended to limit the growth of entitlement programs , such as introducing means testing and gradually raising the eligibility ages for receipt of Social Security and Medicare .\nHe supported substantial increases in military spending and promised to invest more heavily in military weapons programs while increasing the number of active-duty military personnel .\nHe was very supportive of the directions taken by the budget proposals of Paul Ryan , although he later proposed his own budget plan .\nRomney pledged to lead an effort to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( \" Obamacare \" ) and replace it with a system that gives states more control over Medicaid and makes health insurance premiums tax-advantaged for individuals in the same way they are for businesses .\nHe favored repeal of the Dodd \u2013 Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Sarbanes \u2013 Oxley Act and intended to replace them with what he called a \" streamlined , modern regulatory framework \" .\nHe also promised to seek income tax law changes that he said would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate economic growth .\nThese included : reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20 percent , maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15 percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains ( and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $ 200,000 ) , cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25 percent , and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax .\nHe promised that the loss of government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes , but said that that aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress .\nRomney opposed the use of mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions to deal with global warming .\nHe stated that he believed climate change is occurring , but that he did not know how much of it could be linked to human activity .\nHe was a proponent of increased domestic oil drilling , hydraulic fracturing ( \" fracking \" ) , building more nuclear power plants , and reducing the regulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency .\nHe believed North American energy independence could be achieved by 2020 .\nRomney labeled Russia as America 's \" number one geopolitical foe \" , and asserted that preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear capability should be America 's \" highest national security priority \" .\nRomney stated his strong support for Israel .\nHe planned to formally label China a currency manipulator and take associated counteractions unless that country changed its trade practices .\nRomney supported the Patriot Act , the continued operation of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp , and use of enhanced interrogation techniques against suspected terrorists .\nRomney opposed same-sex marriage and civil unions , although he favored domestic partnership legislation that gives certain legal rights to same-sex couples , such as hospital visitation .\nIn 2011 , he signed a pledge promising to seek passage of an amendment to the U.S . Constitution to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman .\nSince 2005 , Romney described himself as \" pro-life \" .\nIn that year , he wrote : \" I believe that abortion is the wrong choice except in cases of incest , rape , and to save the life of the mother . \"\nDuring his 1994 campaign for the senate , Romney had said , \" I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country , \" a stance he reiterated during his 2002 campaign for governor .\nWhile Romney would prefer to see passage of a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion , he did not believe the public would support such an amendment ; as an alternative , he promised to nominate Supreme Court justices who would help overturn Roe v. Wade , allowing each state to decide on the legality of abortion .\nRomney said that he would appoint federal judges in the mold of U.S . Supreme Court justices John Roberts , Clarence Thomas , Antonin Scalia , and Samuel Alito .\nHe advocated judicial restraint and strict constructionism as judicial philosophies .\n= = Subsequent activities = =\nDuring the first year following the election defeat , Romney generally kept a low profile , with his ordinary daily activities around San Diego being captured via social media glimpses .\nIn December 2012 , he joined the board of Marriott International for a third stint as a director .\nIn March 2013 , Romney gave a reflective interview on Fox News Sunday , stating , \" It kills me not to be there , not to be in the White House doing what needs to be done . \"\nHe again expressed regret at the \" 47 percent \" remark , saying \" There 's no question that hurt and did real damage to my campaign . \"\n( He was still echoing both of these sentiments a year later . )\nRomney began working as executive partner group chairman for Solamere Capital , a private capital firm in Boston owned by his son Tagg .\nHe was also involved in supporting several charitable causes .\nThe Romneys bought a home again in the Deer Valley area of Park City , Utah , followed by a property in Holladay , Utah , where they plan to tear down an existing house and build a new one .\nThey also gained long-sought permission to replace their La Jolla home with a much bigger one , including a car elevator that had brought some derision during the 2012 campaign .\nIn addition , Romney and his siblings continue to own a cottage in the gated community called Beach O ' Pines located south of Grand Bend , Ontario , which has been in the family for more than sixty years .\nWith the new acquisitions the couple briefly had five homes , located near each of their five sons and respective families , and the couple continued to spend considerable time with their grandchildren , who by 2013 numbered 22 .\nThey then sold the condominium in Belmont and decided to make their main residence in Utah , including switching voter registration .\nThe 2014 documentary film Mitt showed a behind-the-scenes , family-based perspective on both of Romney 's presidential campaigns and received positive notices for humanizing the candidate and illustrating the toll that campaigning takes .\nRomney himself thought he might be branded a \" loser for life \" and fade into an obscurity like Michael Dukakis ( a similar figure with no obvious base of political support who had lost what his party considered a winnable presidential election ) but , to the surprise of many political observers , that did not happen .\nRomney re-emerged onto the political scene in the run-up to the 2014 U.S. midterm elections , endorsing , campaigning , and fundraising for a number of Republican candidates , especially those running for the U.S . Senate .\n= = = 2016 presidential election and relationship with Donald Trump = = =\nBy early 2014 , the lack of a clear mainstream Republican candidate for the 2016 presidential election led some supporters , donors , and pollsters to suggest Romney stage a third run .\nRegarding such a possibility , Romney at first responded , \" Oh , no , no , no .\nNo , no , no , no , no .\nNo , no , no . \"\nNevertheless , speculation continued : the continuing unpopularity of Obama led to buyer 's remorse among some voters ; the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine made Romney 's \" No .\n1 geopolitical foe \" remark look prescient ; and an August 2014 poll of Iowan Republicans showed Romney with a large lead there over other potential 2016 candidates .\nA poll conducted in July 2014 by CNN showed Romney with a 53 to 44 lead over Obama in a hypothetical election \" redo . \"\nBy early 2015 , Romney was actively considering the idea and contacting his network of supporters .\nIn doing so he was positioning himself in the invisible primary \u2013 the preliminary jockeying for the backing of party leaders , donors , and political operatives \u2013 against former Florida governor Jeb Bush , who had already set a likely campaign in motion and would be a rival to Romney for establishment Republican support .\nDespite support in some quarters for a third bid for the presidency , there was a backlash against him from conservatives who wanted a fresher face without a history of presidential losses , and many of Romney 's past donors were not willing to commit to him again .\nRomney announced on January 30 , 2015 that he would not run for president in 2016 , saying that while he thought he could win the nomination , \" one of our next generation of Republican leaders \" would be better positioned to win the general election .\nAs the Republican presidential nomination race went into the primaries season , Romney had not endorsed anyone but was one of the Republican establishment figures who were becoming increasingly concerned about the front-runner status of New York businessman Donald Trump .\nRomney publicly criticized Trump for not releasing his taxes , saying there might be a \" bombshell \" in them .\nTrump responded by calling Romney \" one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics . \"\nThen Romney gave a speech on March 3 , 2016 , at the Hinckley Institute of Politics , that represented a scathing attack on Trump 's personal behavior , business performance , and domestic and foreign policy stances .\nHe said Trump was \" a phony , a fraud ...\nHe 's playing members of the American public for suckers \" and that \" If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee , the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished . \"\nIn response Trump dismissed Romney as a \" choke artist \" .\nRomney 's speech represented an unprecedented attack by a major U.S. party 's most recent presidential nominee against the party 's current front-runner for the nomination .\nRomney encouraged Republicans to engage in tactical voting , by supporting whichever of the remaining rivals had the best chance to beat Trump in any given state , and as such Romney announced he was voting for , although not endorsing , Ted Cruz for president prior to the March 22 Utah caucus .\nAs the race went on , there was some evidence of tactical voting occurring , and some partial arrangements were formed among candidates , but by May 3 Trump had defeated all his opponents and became the party 's presumptive nominee .\nRomney then announced that he would not support Trump in the general election , saying , \" I am dismayed at where we are now , I wish we had better choices \" .\nIn June , Romney said that he would not vote for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton either , saying : \" It 's a matter of personal conscience .\nI can \u2019 t vote for either of those two people .\n\" He suggested that he may vote for a third-party candidate , or write-in his wife 's name , saying she would be \" an ideal president \" .\nWhen pressed on who of Trump and Clinton was more qualified to be President , Romney quoted P.

        "article":"New Romney is a small town in Kent , England , on the edge of Romney Marsh , an area of flat , rich agricultural land reclaimed from the sea after the harbour began to silt up .\nNew Romney , one of the original Cinque Ports , was once a sea port , with the harbour adjacent to the church , but is now more than a mile from the sea .\nA mooring ring can still be seen in front of the church .\nIt is the headquarters of the Romney , Hythe and Dymchurch Railway .\n= = Geography = =\nNew Romney is not significantly different in age from the nearby village of Old Romney .\nHowever New Romney , now about a mile and a half from the seafront , was originally a harbour town at the mouth of the River Rother .\nThe Rother estuary was always difficult to navigate , with many shallow channels and sandbanks .\nTo make navigation easier two large rocks , one bigger than the other , were placed at the entrance to the main channel .\nThe names of two local settlements , Greatstone and Littlestone , are a reminder of these aids .\nAnother possible explanation for these place-names is a result of the effects of Longshore Drift , which disperses shingle and sand deposits , from west to east , with heavier stones accumulating in the area known as Greatstone , while far smaller shingle is to be found in great quantities at Littlestone .\nVery fine sand is found further east at neighbouring St Mary 's Bay .\n= = History = =\nIn the latter part of the thirteenth century a series of severe storms weakened the coastal defences of Romney Marsh , and the South England flood of February 1287 almost destroyed the town , as it did destroy the nearby ancient parish of Broomhill .\nThe harbour and town were filled with sand , silt , mud and debris , and the River Rother changed course to run out into the sea near Rye , Sussex .\nThe mud , silt and sand were never entirely removed from the town , which is why many old buildings , especially the church , have steps leading down into them from the present pavement level .\nNew Romney is one of the original Cinque Ports of England , although its importance declined rapidly during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries after the loss of the harbour .\nArchaeological investigations in 2007 during replacement of the town 's main drainage have cast new light on the medieval origins and development of the town .\n\" Kent Sites \" , and \" Post Excavation and Research \" , both in Canterbury 's Archaeology , vol .\n29 ( 2004 \u2013 05 ) .Draper , Gillian , Frank Meddens , et al . , The Sea and the Marsh : The Medieval Cinque Port of New Romney Revealed through Archaeological Excavations and Historical Research .\nPCA Monograph 10 .\nPre-Construct Archaeology Ltd ( 2009 ) .\n.\nDuring World War II a fleet of floating concrete harbour sections ( called Mulberry Harbours ) were towed across the English Channel to France to aid the Allied landings .\nOne of these harbour pieces remains , embedded in a sandbank just off the coast by Littlestone-on-Sea , and is clearly visible at low tide .\nFurther up the coast during the Pipe Line Under The Ocean , or PLUTO , oil was pumped to France under the English Channel for use by allied troops .\nNew Romney is the main centre of population on the Romney Marsh .\nFounded in 1610 by John Southland and formerly known locally as just \" Southland 's \" , John Southland 's Community Comprehensive School , the only secondary school in the area , was renamed The Marsh Academy in August 2007 .\n= = Town centre = =\nLike many towns on the marsh it has an impressive Norman church in the centre of town .\nThis church originally stood at the harbourside , and its entrances are several feet below ground level .\nThe church is also notable for the boat hooks still evident on the side walls .\nNew Romney 's historic high street has several small and interesting shops .\nA few businesses closed after the opening of a branch of supermarket chain Sainsbury 's , but the town retains much of its character .\nThe former almshouses in West Street are noted historic buildings of Kent ; they were founded in 1610 by John Southland , an important local magnate , and rebuilt in 1734 .\nAdjacent to these is Plantagenet House and No 3 Old Stone Cottage , which originated as a single house constructed c . 1300 \u2013 1350 , ( Archaeology South East , UCL , report by David Martin , 2004 ) .\nResearchers think it was originally the home of the Master of The Hospital of St John the Baptist , a large secular establishment .\nThe hospital was operating by c . 1260 and flourished until the close of the fifteenth century ( Victoria History and a report by Dr Gillian Draper in the possession of the writer ) .\n3 \/ 4-mile north of the town is the links golf course at Littlestone-on-Sea .\nThe golf course was a favourite of Denis Thatcher , late husband of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher , and has been used several times for the qualifying rounds of The Open Championship .\n= = Transport = =\nThe Romney , Hythe and Dymchurch Railway has a station at the extreme east of New Romney , which as well as being a major tourist attraction was also used by students travelling to school until 2015 .\nThe station is about three-quarters of a mile east of the historic town centre .\nNew Romney was once serviced by the New Romney and Littlestone-On-Sea railway station which was part of the Lydd Line .\nThe station was sited halfway between New Romney and Littlestone-on-Sea .\nAs built the station had two platforms and a small goods yard with four sidings , a goods shed , cattle dock , coal wharves , end loading dock , water tower and other small buildings .\nThe up platform was rarely used in latter years other than as a livestock loading dock .\nThe station was originally called New Romney & Littlestone with on-Sea being added in October 1888 .\nIn 1927 a single line extension was built with an unprotected level crossing to an exchange siding with the adjacent Romney Hythe and Dymchurch Railway station on the opposite side of the Station Road ; it was used to deliver coal to that railway .\nThe signal box was taken out of use in the 1950s and goods service was withdrawn in 1964 .\nThe station was closed in 1967 and replaced with a bus service .\nNew Romney is easily accessible by road , sitting astride the A259 ( which runs from Folkestone to Havant ) .\nSeveral bus services run to and through New Romney from Hastings , Folkestone and Ashford .\n= = Media = =\nNew Romney has one dedicated weekly newspaper , the Kentish Express ( published by the KM Group ) is the only weekly newspaper for the Romney Marsh covering the town .\nThere is also the Folkestone Herald ( which incorporated the Romney Marsh Herald in 2014 , published by Kent Regional News and Media ) .\nThe local radio station for New Romney is KMFM Ashford which contains Marsh-based adverts amongst a county-wide station , and New Romney is also served by the county-wide stations Heart , Gold and BBC Radio Kent .\nIn 1951 the Richard Burton , Roger Livesey , and Honor Blackman film Green Grow the Rushes was made on location in and around New Romney and in nearby St Mary in the Marsh .\n= = Namesakes = =\nIn 1762 Thomas Fairfax , 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron named the town of Romney in present-day West Virginia in the United States after the town of New Romney .\n= = See also = =\n* Henry Sydney , 1st Earl of Romney\n= = References = =\n",

        "article":"George Romney ( 26 December 1734 \u2013 15 November 1802 ) was an English portrait painter .\nHe was the most fashionable artist of his day , painting many leading society figures \u2013 including his artistic muse , Emma Hamilton , mistress of Lord Nelson .\n= = Early life and training = =\nRomney was born in Beckside in Dalton-in-Furness , Lancashire ( now part of Cumbria ) , the 3rd son ( of 11 children ) of John Romney , cabinet maker , and Anne Simpson .\nRaised in a cottage named High Cocken in modern-day Barrow-in-Furness , he was sent to school at nearby Dendron .\nHe appears to have been an indifferent student and was withdrawn at the age of 11 and apprenticed to his father 's business instead .\nHe proved to have a natural ability for drawing and making things from wood \u2013 including violins ( which he played throughout his life ) .\nFrom the age of 15 , he was taught art informally by a local watchmaker called John Williamson , but his studies began in earnest in 1755 , when he went to Kendal , at the age of 21 , for a 4-year apprenticeship with local artist Christopher Steele \u2013 a portraitist who had himself studied with distinguished French artist Carlo Vanloo .\nAll costs were to be borne by George 's father .\nIn October 1756 , Romney married Mary Abbot ( a decision he initially regretted ) , but the couple were immediately separated when he was called away to York on business by his employer .\nAfter a year , Steele eventually agreed to cancel the apprenticeship , at George 's request , leaving the young artist \u2013 now a father of a son \u2013 free to pursue his own career as a painter .\n= = Work = =\n= = = Cumbria = = =\nIn 1757 , Romney rejoined his wife and young son in Kendal , working as a portraitist , landscape and historical painter .\nIn this period he became friends with Adam Walker , the inventor and writer , and also pursued musical interests in his spare time .\nIn March 1762 , he parted from his wife , son and daughter ( the latter dying in 1763 ) , to seek his fortune in London , where he stayed ( apart from a few return visits to Cumbria ) until 1799 .\nThroughout the separation , he maintained contact with his family and financially supported them , but they never lived with him in the capital .\n= = = London = = =\nIn 1763 , Romney entered his painting , The Death of General Wolfe , into a Royal Society of Arts competition .\nAccording to friends of Romney , he was awarded the second prize of 50 guineas , but this was later to reduced to 25 guineas on questionable grounds .\nIt is said that Sir Joshua Reynolds himself was the prime mover behind this decision , a fact which may have accounted for the lifelong aversion of the two men for each other .\nDespite his later success , Romney was never invited to join the Royal Academy of Arts ( formed 1768 ) , though he was asked , urged even , to exhibit there \u2013 nor did he ever apply to join .\nThis decision certainly cost him valuable royal patronage and support from others connected at court .\nWhile there has been much speculation about his actual relationship with the Academy , there is no doubt that he normally remained aloof , maintaining that a good artist should succeed without being a member .\nHis own career supported this belief , and it was only towards the end of his life that he expressed the slightest regret for his views .\nHis early years in the capital were something of a struggle financially .\nIn September 1764 , he travelled to Paris ( with a friend , lawyer Thomas Greene ) for a few weeks to study the works of the old masters ( travel abroad was seen as a requisite of a developing artist 's training as the opportunity to view great art in London was very limited ) .\nIn 1765 he again won the second prize of 50 guineas in the Royal Society of Arts competition .\nIn 1768 , he made the acquaintance of Richard Cumberland , the dramatist , whose portrait he painted , and who was helpful in introducing him to influential patrons .\nHe also became friends with miniature painter Ozias Humphrey .\n1769 was a breakthrough year \u2013 he exhibited a large portrait of Sir George Warren and family at the Free Society of Artists , which was greatly admired and helped to lay the foundations of his future popularity .\nIn 1770 he started to exhibit his work at the Chartered Society of Artists rather the rival \" Free Society of Artists \" .\n= = = Italy = = =\nBy 1772 Romney was financially secure enough to make the journey ( with Ozias Humphrey ) to Italy to study the great artists of the past , as he had always intended .\nHe set off in March , making his way through Europe ( via Paris , Lyon , Marseilles , Nice , Genoa , Livorno , Florence and Pisa ) and arriving in Rome in June .\nA letter of introduction allowed him to meet the Pope , Clement XIV , who allowed him to set up scaffolding in the Vatican to study the frescoes of Raphael .\nHe spent 18 months in Rome making studies and sketches of the great art works on view there .\nHe returned to London in July 1775 ( via Florence , Bologna , Venice , Parma , and Turin ) after an absence of over 2 years .\n= = = Later career = = =\nOn his return , in 1775 , Romney moved to Cavendish Square , in a house formerly owned by noted portraitist Francis Cotes .\nHe was considerably in debt , not only on his own account but also due to being saddled with the debt of his artistic but dissolute brother Peter .\nFortunately , he was offered commissions by the Duke of Richmond and his circle of friends , which helped turn the tide of fortune permanently in the artist 's favour .\nIn 1776 \u2013 77 , he made the acquaintance of William Hayley , striking up a lasting friendship with the writer , and painting portraits for him .\n1782 was the beginning of an important new chapter in Romney 's life , for in that year he was first introduced to Emma Hamilton ( then called Emma Hart ) who became his muse .\nHe painted over 60 portraits of her in various poses , sometimes playing the part of historical or mythological figures .\nHe also painted many other contemporaries , including fellow artist Mary Moser .\nIn 1797 Romney left his studio at 32 Cavendish Square , where he had worked for more than twenty years , to move to Holly Bush Hill in Hampstead .\nIn Hampstead Romney embarked on a series of costly building projects , and sold the house two years later .\nRomney 's House is now a Grade I listed building , and Romney is commemorated by a blue plaque placed on the property .\nIn the summer of 1799 , his health broken , and after an absence of almost forty years , Romney returned to his wife , Mary , in Kendal .\nShe nursed him during the remaining 2 years of his life until he died in November 1802 .\nHe was buried in the churchyard of St. Mary 's Parish Church , Dalton-in-Furness .\nGeorge Romney is a kinsman of American businessmen and politicians George W. Romney ( 1907 \u2013 1995 ) and Mitt Romney ( born 1947 ) ; their ancestor Miles Romney was George Romney 's first cousin .\n= = Public collections of works = =\nRomney 's work is on display at many museums and art Galleries in the UK , North America and elsewhere :\n; UK and Ireland :\n* Abbot Hall Art Gallery ( Kendal ) ; Kendal Town Hall ( Kendal ) ; Ashmolean Museum ( University of Oxford ) ; Courtauld Institute of Art ( London ) ; Dorset County Museum ( Dorchester ) ; Dulwich Picture Gallery ( London ) ; National Portrait Gallery , London ; National Maritime Museum ( London ) ; Tate Gallery ( London ) ; Wallace Collection ( London ) ; Falmouth Art Gallery ; Fitzwilliam Museum ( University of Cambridge ) ; Dalton Castle ; Manchester City Art Gallery ; National Museum Cardiff ; National Museums Liverpool ; New Art Gallery ( Walsall ) ; National Galleries of Scotland ; Crawford Municipal Art Gallery ( Ireland ) ; Waddesdon Manor ( Buckinghamshire ) .\n; United States and Canada :\n* Ackland Art Museum ( University of North Carolina ) ; Art Gallery of the University of Rochester ( New York ) ; Art Institute of Chicago ; Beaverbrook Art Gallery ( New Brunswick ) ; Blanton Museum of Art ( University of Texas at Austin ) ; Brigham Young University Museum of Art ( Utah ) ; Carnegie Museum of Art ( Pittsburgh ) ; Dallas Museum of Art ; Detroit Institute of Arts ; the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco , Robert Hull Fleming Museum ( University of Vermont ) ; Frick Collection ( New York City ) ; Forsyth County Public Library Central Branch , Winston-Salem , North Carolina ; the Getty Museum ( Los Angeles ) ; Harvard University Art Museums ; Honolulu Museum of Art ; Huntington Library ( California ) ; the Kimbell Art Museum ( Fort Worth , Texas ) ; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art ; Metropolitan Museum of Art ( New York City ) ; Museum of Fine Arts , Houston ( Texas ) ; Museum of Fine Arts , Boston ; National Gallery of Art ( Washington D.C . ) ; Norton Simon Museum ( Pasadena , California ) ; Philadelphia Museum of Art ; Wadsworth Atheneum ( Hartford , Connecticut ) ; Phoenix Art Museum ( Phoenix , Arixona ) ; National Gallery of Canada ; Folger Shakespeare Library ( Washington , D.C . ) .\n; Elsewhere :\n* Dunedin Public Art Gallery ( New Zealand ) ; Hermitage Museum ( St. Petersburg , Russia ) , Louvre ( Paris , France ) ; Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts ( Pau , France ) , National Gallery of Victoria ( Australia ) , MASP ( Brazil ) .\n= = Gallery = =\nFile : Romney yg man.jpg | Young Man with a Flute , late 1760s Dallas Museum of Art\nFile : Granville Leveson-Gower \u00b4 s children.jpg | Granville Leveson-Gower \u00b4 s children , 1776 \u2013 7\nFile : George Romney 002.jpg | Portrait of Miss Juliana Willoughby , 1781 \u2013 88\nFile : George Romney - Lady Hamilton as Circe.jpg | Lady Hamilton as Circe , c . 1782\nFile : Macbeth and the witches ( Romney 1785 ) .jpg | Macbeth and the witches , 1785\nFile : George Romney - Lady Hamilton ( as a Bacchante ) 3.jpg | Emma Hamilton as a bacchante , 1785\nFile : John Henderson as Macbeth ( Romney , c . 1787 ) .jpg | John Henderson as Macbeth , c . 1787\nFile : ArchibaldCampbell.jpg | Major General Sir Archibald Campbell K.B .\nof Inverneill , 1790 \u2013 1792\nFile : George Romney - Lady Hamilton as The Magdalene.jpg | The Magdalene before 1792\nFile : The infant Shakespeare attended by Nature and the Passions ( Romney , c . 1791-1792 ) .jpg | The infant Shakespeare attended by Nature and the Passions , c . 1791 \u2013 1792\nFile : Lady Hamilton as Titania with Puck and Changeling ( Romney , 1793 ) .jpg | Lady Hamilton as Titania with Puck and Changeling , 1793\n= = See also = =\n* English school of painting\n= = References = =\n= = Further reading = =\n* Cleve , Rowley .\nGeorge Romney ( London : G.

        "article":"The Romney , formerly called the Romney Marsh sheep but generally referred to by the local farmers as the Kent , is a breed of sheep originating in England .\nThe Romney is a \" long-wool \" breed recognized in England by 1800 .\nExported to other continents , the Romney is an economically important sheep breed , especially to the sheep-meat and wool export trades of New Zealand .\n= = History of the breed = =\n= = = Origins = = =\nThe breed evolved from medieval longwool types of which the Romney and Leicester breeds are early examples .\nThe sheep recognized by 1800 as \" Romney Marsh \" or \" Kent \" were improved in body type and fleece quality through crossings with Bakewell \u2019 s English Leicester .\nA Romney can be either colored or white .\n= = = International spread = = =\nThe first confirmed export of Romneys from England was a shipment of 20 from Stone , Kent that went on the Cornwall to New Zealand in 1853 .\nWith these and a further 30 ewes sent in 1856 , Alfred Ludlum established New Zealand \u2019 s first Romney Marsh stud in 1860 at Newry , in the Hutt Valley , and Ludlam 's brother-in-law , Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes , also bred them around this time in Australia \u2014 at his famous sheep property , Yarralumla .\nIn 1855 , 60,000 Merinos had been in NZ , but the Romney Marsh sheep thrived more quickly , supplanting the Merino over most of the country .\nThe New Zealand Romney Marsh Association was formed in 1904 .\nAlfred Matthews was the first president ; the stud he founded , Waiorongamai , is still going .\nIn 1965 , three-quarters of the national flock was Romney\nIn the mid-1990s , Romneys comprised 58 % of the New Zealand sheep flock ( estimated in 2000 at 45 million ) , with Coopworths ( originally Border Leicester on Romney crosses ) and Perendales ( originally Cheviot on Romney crosses ) making up another 16.6 % of the national flock , in which Merinos stood at 7 % and Corriedales at 5.5 % .\nThe New Zealand export lamb trade started in 1882 with a shipment aboard the Dunedin of 4900 frozen carcasses to London \u2019 s Smithfield Market .\nThis was by far the biggest meat cargo ever carried over such a distance to that time .\nFebruary 15 , the departure date , is still celebrated as New Zealand Lamb Day .\nAfter 1932 , the technology for shipping chilled fresh meat by sea ( and later by air ) further enhanced the export trade .\nThe story of Romneys is hardly limited to England and New Zealand .\nThe breed has been established in settings as different as Patagonia , Australia , Portugal , Brazil , Canada , and Southern California .\nFor many years , England was the primary source of export Romneys .\nBetween 1900 and 1955 , 18000 rams and 9000 ewes went from England to 43 countries .\n( ref 7 p . 20 ) New Zealand itself began exporting after the sensational win of Ernest Short \u2019 s Parorangi ram at the Argentine International Exhibition in 1906 .\nHealth requirements in recent decades have made New Zealand and Australia almost the only breeding ground for exported Romney seed stock , with Brazil , Uruguay , the Falklands , the U.S . , and England , itself , some of the recipient countries .\n= = Description = =\n= = = Attributes = = =\nThe economic success of the Romney in New Zealand over a century and a half says volumes , but does not make the breed ideal for every situation .\nHenry Fell in Intensive Sheep Management posits that the Romney is , \u201c A breed which ha [ s ] all the virtues save one , that of prolificacy \u2026 will thrive happily at extraordinary densities and seems to enjoy it . \u201d A number of large Romney flocks in New Zealand have in the last several decades achieved better than 1.7 lambs for every ewe exposed to the ram , showing much better prolificacy than Fell had observed in England .\nSome leaders are going yet higher , still with good survivability .\nAlmost every detailed description of the Romney cites relative resistance to foot rot , an attribute rarely mentioned in descriptions of other breeds .\n\u201c It is said that foot rot and liver fluke seldom affect Romney Marsh sheep . \u201d reads a 1918 American text .\nA later book is more circumspect : \u201c Romneys are said to be somewhat resistant to foot rot , liver flukes and other problems that often plague sheep in damp pastures . \u201d\n= = = Appearance = = =\nThe Romney is in general an open-faced breed with long wool that grows over the legs in full .\nRomney breed standards are not identical across all countries , but have much in common .\nThe oldest Romney breed society , that of England ( founded 1895 ) , adopted the following standard in 1991 , The Official Description of the typical Romney sheep is as follows : Head wide , level between ears , with no horns nor dark hair on the poll .\nEyes should be large , bright and prominent and the mouth sound .\nFace in ewes full , and in rams broad and masculine in appearance .\nNose and hooves should be black .\nNeck well set in at the shoulders , strong and not too long .\nShoulders well put in and level with the back .\nChest wide and deep .\nBack straight and long , with a wide and deep loin .\nRump wide , long and well-turned .\nTail set almost even with the chine .\nThighs well let down and developed .\nThe face should be white , and the skin of a clean pink colour .\nRibs should be well sprung .\nLegs well set , with good bone and sound feet .\nSheep should stand well on their pasterns .\nThe fleece should be of white colour , even texture and a good decided staple from top of head to end of tail and free from kemp .\nA Romney may have either a colored or white fleece .\nToday \u2019 s Romney sheep varies among and also within continents , especially as to body size .\nThe breed can still be characterized in that respect as being in the larger half of the spectrum represented say by Cheviot ( smaller end ) to Lincoln ( larger end ) .\nAn English description of size speaks of \u201c big sheep \u201d \u2014 ewes , to 85 kg , rams to 110 kg , while the American breed standard calls for ewes at breeding age to be \u201c 140 lbs or more \u201d and rams \u201c 200 lbs or more . \u201d\nThe registering bodies for most sheep breeds continue to struggle with the question of what size is just right and with other finer details .\nThese questions have no transnational or even national answers .\nRelevant issues include economics , ecology , and the exigencies ( in some countries ) of the show ring .\n= = = Fleece characteristics = = =\nRomneys produce a heavy fleece .\nA healthy mature ram can yield at shearing upwards of 10 kg per year , while flock averages in NZ for breeding ewes are typically above 5 kg .\nThe increased fleece weight of a long-wooled sheep comes from the longer fiber length produced .\nA finer-wooled sheep ( e.g.\nMerino , Rambouillet ) actually has far more wool follicles than the long-wooled sheep , but each supports a slower-growing fiber that is , therefore , shorter at periodic shearing .\nThe \u201c clean yield \u201d ( net weight after thorough washing ) is typically high for Romneys , 75-80 % ; this is a higher yield than is got for most fine-wooled sheep .\nPerhaps the most important dimension of wool , which above all else determines its best use , is average fiber diameter ( AFD ) .\nRomneys are strong-wooled sheep , with an AFD higher than many sheep breeds .\nHigh AFD indicates best use in carpeting and other rugged uses ; lowest AFD wools ( from Merinos , for example ) are ideal for fine suit fabrics and luxury wear .\nAFD must be measured with instruments .\nThe time-honored \u201c Bradford system \u201d , which uses the eyes and hands of experienced humans , has some correlation to measured AFD , but can be biased .\nThe American Romney Breeders Association declares the Romney fleece should be [ Bradford system ] \u201c 44s to 50s . \u201d Transformed arbitrarily into microns by the United States Department of Agriculture this range would correspond to 29.30 to 36.19 microns .\nIn New Zealand the standard says \u201c 44s to 52s \u201d but gives a different AFD range : 33 to 37 microns .\nNo international agreement exists on converting Bradford counts into AFD in microns .\nThe Romney \u2019 s fleece is ideal for hand-spinning , and is often recommended to beginners .\nIn the United States , where no commercial end-use for domestic strong wools exists , the most desired outlet for Romney wool is to hand-spinners .\nOnly a small fraction of the thousands of Romney fleeces shorn in the US each year , however , go to this \u201c niche-market \u201d use .\nRomney wool in NZ goes mostly into that country \u2019 s vast shipments of wool for the rug and carpet factories of the European Union , Asia , the USA , Australia , and NZ itself .\nAn increasing amount recently has been going to China .\nNew Zealand is the world \u2019 s largest producer and exporter of \u201c strong crossbred \u201d wool ( a term for wool with average fiber diameter > 35.4 microns ) .\nIn 2002-2003 , the country exported about 138,000 tonnes of wool \" clean basis \" , about half of which was of AFD > 35.4 microns , the Romney domain .\n\" Clean basis \" refers to the net weight anticipated after thorough washing ( see \" clean yield \" above ) ; much wool moved internationally is shipped before washing as the natural oils in the fleece make it travel better .\nIn the same year , total wool exports returned nearly NZ $ one billion , about 3 % of total merchandise exports revenues for the country .\nIn North America and England , natural-colored Romneys ( whose fleeces are not white , but black , gray , silver , variegated ) have come to be valued for what they bring to hand-spinners and weavers who like the palette of natural colors .\nTraditionally , natural-colored ( or \u201c black \u201d ) sheep were detested , as even a small amount of black fiber on an otherwise white sheep can ruin hundreds of pounds of textile .\nSince 1972 , natural-colored Romneys have been registered with the American Romney Breeders \u2019 Association ( founded 1911 ) , which has developed a special breed standard for them .\nIn New Zealand natural colored Romneys can be registered in the Romney section of the Black and Natural-colored Sheep Breeders Association , but are still eyed with suspicion by many breeders of white Romneys .\n= = Economic importance = =\nThe sheer number of Romney ewes and lambs in New Zealand make the breed not only the biggest input by tonnage to overseas and domestic wool trade , but also the major part of the country \u2019 s export frozen lamb trade , as purebreds and first-generation crosses .\nNew Zealand is the world \u2019 s largest exporter of frozen and chilled lamb .\nIn 2008 , NZ sheep-meat exports ( mostly of lamb ) brought in more than half of the country \u2019 s NZ $ 4.5 billion meat export revenues .\n= = See also = =\n* Bradford system\n* Sheep shearing\n* Wool classing\n= = References = =\n= = External links = =\n* The Romney Sheep

        "article":"George Wilcken Romney ( July 8 , 1907 \u2013 July 26 , 1995 ) was an American businessman and Republican Party politician .\nHe was chairman and president of American Motors Corporation from 1954 to 1962 , the 43rd Governor of Michigan from 1963 to 1969 , and the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 1969 to 1973 .\nHe was the father of 2003 \u2013 07 Governor of Massachusetts and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney , husband of 1970 U.S . Senate candidate Lenore Romney , and grandfather of 2017 \u2013 present Republican National Committee chair Ronna Romney McDaniel .\nRomney was born to American parents living in the Mormon colonies in Mexico ; events during the Mexican Revolution forced his family to flee back to the United States when he was a child .\nThe family lived in several states and ended up in Salt Lake City , Utah , where they struggled during the Great Depression .\nRomney worked in a number of jobs , served as a Mormon missionary in the United Kingdom , and attended several colleges in the U.S. but did not graduate from any of them .\nIn 1939 he moved to Detroit and joined the American Automobile Manufacturers Association , where he served as the chief spokesman for the automobile industry during World War II and headed a cooperative arrangement in which companies could share production improvements .\nHe joined Nash-Kelvinator in 1948 , and became the chief executive of its successor , American Motors Corporation , in 1954 .\nThere he turned around the struggling firm by focusing all efforts on the compact Rambler car .\nRomney mocked the products of the \" Big Three \" automakers as \" gas-guzzling dinosaurs \" and became one of the first high-profile , media-savvy business executives .\nDevoutly religious , he presided over the Detroit Stake of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints .\nHaving entered politics by participating in a state constitutional convention to rewrite the Michigan Constitution during 1961 \u2013 1962 , Romney was elected Governor of Michigan in 1962 .\nRe-elected by increasingly large margins in 1964 and 1966 , he worked to overhaul the state 's financial and revenue structure , greatly expanding the size of state government and introducing Michigan 's first state income tax .\nRomney was a strong supporter of the American Civil Rights Movement .\nHe briefly represented moderate Republicans against conservative Republican Barry Goldwater during the 1964 U.S. presidential election .\nHe requested the intervention of federal troops during the 1967 Detroit riot .\nInitially a front runner for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the 1968 election , he proved an ineffective campaigner and fell behind Richard Nixon in polls .\nAfter a mid-1967 remark that his earlier support for the Vietnam War had been due to a \" brainwashing \" by U.S. military and diplomatic officials in Vietnam , his campaign faltered even more and he withdrew from the contest in early 1968 .\nAfter Nixon 's election as president , he appointed Romney as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development .\nRomney 's ambitious plans for housing production increases for the poor , and for open housing to desegregate suburbs , were modestly successful but often thwarted by Nixon .\nRomney left the administration at the start of Nixon 's second term in 1973 .\nReturning to private life , he advocated volunteerism and public service , and headed the National Center for Voluntary Action and its successor organizations from 1973 through 1991 .\nHe also served as a regional representative of the Twelve within his church .\n= = Early life and background = =\nRomney 's grandparents were polygamous Mormons who fled the United States with their children owing to the federal government 's prosecution of polygamy .\nHis maternal grandfather was Helaman Pratt ( 1846 \u2013 1909 ) , who presided over the Mormon mission in Mexico City before moving to the Mexican state of Chihuahua and who was the son of original Mormon apostle Parley P. Pratt ( 1807 \u2013 1857 ) .\nIn the 1920s , Romney 's uncle Rey L. Pratt ( 1878 \u2013 1931 ) played a major role in the preservation and expansion of the Mormon presence in Mexico and in its introduction to South America .\nA more distant kinsman was George Romney ( 1734 \u2013 1802 ) , a noted portrait painter in Britain during the last quarter of the 18th century .\nRomney 's parents , Gaskell Romney ( 1871 \u2013 1955 ) and Anna Amelia Pratt ( 1876 \u2013 1926 ) , were United States citizens and natives of the Territory of Utah .\nThey married in 1895 in Mexico and lived in Colonia Dubl\u00e1n in Galeana in the state of Chihuahua ( one of the Mormon colonies in Mexico ) , where George was born on July 8 , 1907 .\nThey practiced monogamy ( polygamy having been abolished by the 1890 Manifesto , although it persisted in places , especially Mexico ) .\nGeorge had three older brothers , two younger brothers , and a younger sister .\nGaskell Romney was a successful carpenter , house builder , and farmer who headed the most prosperous family in the colony , which was situated in an agricultural valley below the Sierra Madre Occidental .\nThe family chose U.S. citizenship for their children , including George .\nThe Mexican Revolution broke out in 1910 and the Mormon colonies were endangered in 1911 \u2013 1912 by raids from marauders , including \" Red Flaggers \" Pascual Orozco and Jos\u00e9 In\u00e9s Salazar .\nYoung George heard the sound of distant gunfire and saw rebels walking through the village streets .\nThe Romney family fled and returned to the United States in July 1912 , leaving their home and almost all of their property behind .\nRomney later said , \" We were the first displaced persons of the 20th century . \"\nIn the United States , Romney grew up in humble circumstances .\nThe family subsisted with other Mormon refugees on government relief in El Paso , Texas , benefiting from a $ 100,000 fund for refugees that the U.S . Congress had set up .\nAfter a few months they moved to Los Angeles , California , where Gaskell Romney worked as a carpenter .\nIn kindergarten , other children mocked Romney 's national origin by calling him \" Mex \" .\nIn 1913 , the family moved to Oakley , Idaho , and bought a farm , where they grew and subsisted largely on Idaho potatoes .\nThe farm was not on good land and failed when potato prices fell .\nThe family moved to Salt Lake City , Utah , in 1916 , where Gaskell Romney resumed construction work , but the family remained generally poor .\nIn 1917 , they moved to Rexburg , Idaho , where Gaskell became a successful home and commercial builder in a growing area due to high World War I commodities prices .\nGeorge started working in wheat and sugar beet fields at the age of eleven and was the valedictorian at his grammar school graduation in 1921 ( by the sixth grade he had attended six different schools ) .\nThe Depression of 1920 \u2013 21 brought a collapse in prices , and local building was abandoned .\nHis family returned to Salt Lake City in 1921 , and while his father resumed construction work , George became skilled at lath-and-plaster work .\nThe family was again prospering when the Great Depression hit in 1929 and ruined them .\nGeorge watched his parents fail financially in Idaho and Utah and having to take a dozen years to pay off their debts .\nSeeing their struggles influenced his life and business career .\nIn Salt Lake City , Romney worked while attending Roosevelt Junior High School and , beginning in 1922 , Latter-day Saints High School .\nThere he played halfback on the football team , guard on the basketball team , and right field on the baseball team , all with more persistence than talent , but in an effort to uphold the family tradition of athleticism , he earned varsity letters in all three sports .\nIn his senior year , he and junior Lenore LaFount became high school sweethearts ; she was from a more well-assimilated Mormon family .\nAcademically , Romney was steady but undistinguished .\nHe graduated from high school in 1925 ; his yearbook picture caption was \" Serious , high minded , of noble nature \u2013 a real fellow . \"\nPartly to stay near Lenore , Romney spent the next year as a junior college student at the co-located Latter-day Saints University , where he was elected student body president .\nHe was also president of the booster club and played on the basketball team that won the Utah \u2013 Idaho Junior College Tournament .\n= = Missionary work = =\nAfter becoming an elder , Romney earned enough money working to fund himself as a Mormon missionary .\nIn October 1926 , he sailed to Great Britain and was first assigned to preach in a slum in Glasgow , Scotland .\nThe abject poverty and hopelessness he saw there affected him greatly , but he was ineffective in gaining converts and temporarily suffered a crisis of faith .\nIn February 1927 , he was shifted to Edinburgh and in February 1928 to London , where he kept track of mission finances .\nHe worked under renowned Quorum of the Twelve Apostles intellectuals James E. Talmage and John A. Widtsoe ; the latter 's admonitions to \" Live mightily today , the greatest day of all time is today \" made a lasting impression on him .\nRomney experienced British sights and culture and was introduced to members of the peerage and the Oxford Group .\nIn August 1928 , Romney became president of the Scottish missionary district .\nOperating in a whisky-centric region was difficult , and he developed a new \" task force \" approach of sending more missionaries to a single location at a time ; this successfully drew local press attention and several hundred new recruits .\nRomney 's frequent public proselytizing \u2013 from Edinburgh 's Mound and in London from soap boxes at Speakers ' Corner in Hyde Park and from a platform at Trafalgar Square \u2013 developed his gifts for debate and sales , which he would use the rest of his career .\nThree decades later , Romney said that his missionary time had meant more to him in developing his career than any other experience .\n= = Early career , marriage and children = =\nRomney returned to the U.S. in late 1928 and studied briefly at the University of Utah and LDS Business College .\nHe followed LaFount to Washington , D.C . , in fall 1929 , after her father , Harold A. Lafount , had accepted an appointment by President Calvin Coolidge to serve on the Federal Radio Commission .\nHe worked for Massachusetts Democratic U.S . Senator David I. Walsh during 1929 and 1930 , first as a stenographer using speedwriting , then , when his abilities at that proved limited , as a staff aide working on tariffs and other legislative matters .\nRomney researched aspects of the proposed Smoot-Hawley tariff legislation and sat in on committee meetings ; the job was a turning point in his career and gave him lifelong confidence in dealing with Congress .\nWith one of his brothers , Romney opened a dairy bar in nearby Rosslyn , Virginia , during this time .\nThe business soon failed , in the midst of the Great Depression .\nHe also attended George Washington University at night .\nBased upon a connection he made working for Walsh , Romney was hired as an apprentice for Alcoa in Pittsburgh in June 1930 .\nWhen LaFount , an aspiring actress , began earning bit roles in Hollywood movies , Romney arranged to be transferred to Alcoa 's Los Angeles office for training as a salesman .\nThere he took night classes at the University of Southern California .\n( Romney did not attend for long , or graduate from , any of the colleges in which he was enrolled , accumulating only 2 \u00bd years of credits ; instead he has been described as an autodidact . )\nLaFount had the opportunity to sign a $ 50,000 , three-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios , but Romney convinced her to return to Washington with him as he was assigned a position there with Alcoa as a lobbyist .\nShe later said she had never had a choice of both marriage and an acting career , because the latter would have upstaged him , but expressed no regrets about having chosen the former .\nRomney would later consider wooing her his greatest sales achievement .\nThe couple married on July 2 , 1931 , at Salt Lake City Temple .\nThey would have four children : Margo Lynn ( born 1935 ) , Jane LaFount ( born 1938 ) , George Scott ( born 1941 ) , and Willard Mitt ( born 1947 ) .\nThe couple 's marriage reflected aspects of their personalities and courtship .\nGeorge was devoted to Lenore , and tried to bring her a flower every day , often a single rose with a love note .\nGeorge was also a strong , blunt personality used to winning arguments by force of will , but the more self-controlled Lenore was unintimidated and willing to push back against him .\nThe couple quarreled so much as a result that their grandchildren would later nickname them \" the Bickersons \" , but in the end , their closeness would allow them to settle arguments amicably .\nAs a lobbyist , Romney frequently competed on behalf of the aluminum industry against the copper industry , and defended Alcoa against charges of being a monopoly .\nHe also represented the Aluminum Wares Association .\nIn the early 1930s , he helped get aluminum windows installed in the U.S . Department of Commerce Building , at the time the largest office building in the world .\nRomney joined the National Press Club and the Burning Tree and Congressional Country Clubs ; one reporter watching Romney hurriedly play golf at the last said , \" There is a young man who knows where he is going . \"\nLenore 's cultural refinement and hosting skills , along with her father 's social and political connections , helped George in business , and the couple met the Hoovers , the Roosevelts , and other prominent Washington figures .\nHe was chosen by Pyke Johnson , a Denver newspaperman and automotive industry trade representative he met at the Press Club , to join the newly formed Trade Association Advisory Committee to the National Recovery Administration .\nThe committee 's work continued even after the agency was declared unconstitutional in 1935 .\nDuring 1937 and 1938 , Romney was also president of the Washington Trade Association Executives .\n= = Automotive industry representative = =\nAfter nine years with Alcoa , Romney 's career had stagnated ; there were many layers of executives to climb through and a key promotion he had wanted was given to someone with more seniority .\nPyke Johnson was vice president of the Automobile Manufacturers Association , which needed a manager for its new Detroit office .\nRomney got the job and moved there with his wife and two daughters in 1939 .\nAn association study found Americans using their cars more for short trips and convinced Romney that the trend was towards more functional , basic transportation .\nIn 1942 , he was promoted to general manager of the association , a position he held until 1948 .\nRomney also served as president of the Detroit Trade Association in 1941 .\nIn 1940 , as World War II raged overseas , Romney helped start the Automotive Committee for Air Defense , which coordinated planning between the automobile and aircraft industries .\nImmediately following the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor that drew the U.S. into the war , Romney helped turn that committee into , and became managing director of , the Automotive Council for War Production .\nThis organization established a cooperative arrangement in which companies could share machine tools and production improvements , thus maximizing the industry 's contribution to the war production effort .\nIt embodied Romney 's notion of \" competitive cooperative capitalism \" .\nWith labor leader Victor Reuther , Romney led the Detroit Victory Council , which sought to improve conditions for Detroit workers under wartime stress and deal with the causes of the Detroit race riot of 1943 .\nRomney successfully appealed to the Federal Housing Administration to make housing available to black workers near the Ford Willow Run plant .\nHe also served on the labor-management committee of the Detroit section of the War Manpower Commission .\nRomney became the chief spokesman of the automobile industry , often testifying before Congressional hearings about production , labor , and management issues ; he was mentioned or quoted in over 80 stories in The New York Times during this time .\nBy war 's end , 654 manufacturing companies had joined the Automotive Council for War Production , and produced nearly $ 29 billion in output for the Allied military forces .\nThis included over 3 million motorized vehicles , 80 percent of all tanks and tank parts , 75 percent of all aircraft engines , half of all diesel engines , and a third of all machine guns .\nBetween a fifth and a quarter of all U.S. wartime production was accounted for by the automotive industry .\nAs peacetime production began , Romney persuaded government officials to forgo complex contract-termination procedures , thus freeing auto plants to quickly produce cars for domestic consumption and avoid large layoffs .\nRomney was director of the American Trade Association Executives in 1944 and 1947 , and managing director of the National Automobile Golden Jubilee Committee in 1946 .\nFrom 1946 to 1949 , he represented U.S. employers as a delegate to the Metal Trades Industry conference of the International Labor Office .\nBy 1950 , Romney was a member of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council , and criticized racial segregation in Detroit 's housing program when speaking before the Detroit City Council .\nRomney 's personality was blunt and intense , giving the impression of a \" man in a hurry \" , and he was considered a rising star in the industry .\n= = American Motors Corporation chief executive = =\nAs managing director of the Automobile Manufacturers Association , Romney became good friends with then-president George W. Mason .\nWhen Mason became chairman of the manufacturing firm Nash-Kelvinator in 1948 , he invited Romney along \" to learn the business from the ground up \" as his roving assistant , and the new executive spent a year working in different parts of the company .\nAt an inefficient Detroit refrigerator plant of the Kelvinator appliance division , Romney battled the Mechanics Educational Society of America union to institute a new industrial \u2013 labor relations program that forestalled the whole facility being shut down .\nHe appealed to the workers by saying , \" I am no college man .\nI 've laid floors , I 've done lathing .\nI 've thinned beets and shocked wheat . \"\nAs Mason 's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 , Romney assumed executive assignment for the development of the Rambler .\nMason had long sought a merger of Nash-Kelvinator with one or more other companies , and on May 1 , 1954 , it merged with Hudson Motor Car to become the American Motors Corporation ( AMC ) .\nIt was the largest merger in the history of the industry , and Romney became an executive vice president of the new firm .\nIn October 1954 , Mason suddenly died of acute pancreatitis and pneumonia .\nRomney was named AMC 's president and chairman of the board the same month .\nWhen Romney took over , he reorganized upper management , brought in younger executives , and pruned and rebuilt AMC 's dealer network .\nRomney believed that the only way to compete with the \" Big Three \" ( General Motors , Ford , and Chrysler ) was to stake the future of AMC on a new smaller-sized car line .\nTogether with chief engineer Meade Moore , by the end of 1957 Romney had completely phased out the Nash and Hudson brands , whose sales had been lagging .\nThe Rambler brand was selected for development and promotion , as AMC pursued an innovative strategy : manufacturing only compact cars .\nThe company struggled badly at first , losing money in 1956 , more in 1957 , and experiencing defections from its dealer network .\nRomney instituted company-wide savings and efficiency measures , and he and other executives reduced their salaries by up to 35 percent .\nThough AMC was on the verge of being taken over by corporate raider Louis Wolfson in 1957 , Romney was able to fend him off .\nThen sales of the Rambler finally took off , leading to unexpected financial success for AMC .\nIt posted its first quarterly profit in three years in 1958 , was the only car company to show increased sales during the recession of 1958 , and moved from thirteenth to seventh place among worldwide auto manufacturers .\nIn contrast with the Hudson 's NASCAR racing success in the early 1950s , the Ramblers were frequent winners in the coast-to-coast Mobil Economy Run , an annual event on U.S . highways .\nSales remained strong during 1960 and 1961 ; the Rambler was America 's third most popular car both years .\nA believer in \" competitive cooperative consumerism \" , Romney was effective in his frequent appearances before Congress .\nHe discussed what he saw as the twin evils of \" big labor \" and \" big business \" , and called on Congress to break up the Big Three .\nAs the Big Three automakers introduced ever-larger models , AMC undertook a \" gas-guzzling dinosaur fighter \" strategy , and Romney became the company spokesperson in print advertisements , public appearances , and commercials on the Disneyland television program .\nKnown for his fast-paced , shirt-sleeved management style that ignored organization charts and levels of responsibility , he often wrote the ad copy himself .\nRomney became what automotive writer Joe Sherman termed \" a folk hero of the American auto industry \" and one of the first high-profile media-savvy business executives .\nHis focus on small cars as a challenge to AMC 's domestic competitors , as well as the foreign-car invasion , was documented in the April 6 , 1959 , cover story of Time magazine , which concluded that \" Romney has brought off singlehanded one of the most remarkable selling jobs in U.S .\nindustry . \"\nA full biography of him was published in 1960 ; the company 's resurgence made Romney a household name .\nThe Associated Press named Romney its Man of the Year in Industry for four consecutive years , 1958 through 1961 .\nThe company 's stock rose from $ 7 per share to $ 90 per share , making Romney a millionaire from stock options .\nHowever , whenever he felt his salary and bonus was excessively high for a year , he gave the excess back to the company .\nAfter initial wariness , he developed a good relationship with United Automobile Workers leader Walter Reuther , and AMC workers also benefited from a then-novel profit-sharing plan .\nRomney was one of only a few Michigan corporate chiefs to support passage and implementation of the state Fair Employment Practices Act .\n= = Local church and civic leadership = =\nReligion was a paramount force in Romney 's life .\nIn a 1959 essay for the Detroit Free Press he said , \" My religion is my most precious possession .\n...\nExcept for my religion , I easily could have become excessively occupied with industry , social and recreational activities .\nSharing personal responsibility for church work with my fellow members has been a vital counterbalance in my life . \"\nFollowing LDS Church practices , he did not drink alcohol or caffeinated beverages , smoke , or swear .\nRomney and his wife tithed , and from 1955 to 1965 , gave 19 percent of their income to the church and another 4 percent to charity .\nRomney was a high priest in the Melchizedek priesthood of the LDS , and beginning in 1944 he headed the Detroit church branch ( which initially was small enough to meet in a member 's house ) .\nBy the time he was AMC chief , he presided over the Detroit Stake , which included not only all of Metro Detroit , Ann Arbor , and the Toledo area of Ohio but also the western edge of Ontario along the Michigan border .\nIn this role , Romney oversaw the religious work of some 2,700 church members , occasionally preached sermons , and supervised the construction of the first stake tabernacle east of the Mississippi River in 100 years .\nBecause the stake covered part of Canada , he often interacted with Canadian Mission President Thomas S. Monson .\nRomney 's rise to a leadership role in the church reflected the church 's journey from a fringe pioneer religion to one that was closely associated with mainstream American business and values .\nDue in part to his prominence , the larger Romney family tree would become viewed as \" LDS royalty \" .\nRomney and his family lived in affluent Bloomfield Hills , having moved there from Detroit around 1953 .\nHe became deeply active in Michigan civic affairs .\nHe was on the board of directors of the Children 's Hospital of Michigan and the United Foundation of Detroit , and was chairman of the executive committee of the Detroit Round Table of Catholics , Jews , and Protestants .\nIn 1959 , he received the Anti-Defamation League of B 'nai 's Americanism award .\nStarting in 1956 , Romney headed a citizen-based committee for improved educational programs in Detroit 's public schools .\nThe 1958 final report of the Citizens Advisory Committee on School Needs was largely Romney 's work and received considerable public attention ; it made nearly 200 recommendations for economy and efficiency , better teacher pay , and new infrastructure funding .\nRomney helped a $ 90-million education-related bond issue and tax increase win an upset victory in an April 1959 statewide referendum .\nHe organized Citizens for Michigan in 1959 , a nonpartisan group that sought to study Detroit 's problems and build an informed electorate .\nCitizens for Michigan built on Romney 's belief that assorted interest groups held too much influence in government , and that only the cooperation of informed citizens acting for the benefit of all could counter them .\nBased on his fame and accomplishments in a state where automobile making was a central topic of conversation , Romney was seen as a natural to enter politics .\nHe first became directly involved in politics in 1959 , when he was a key force in the petition drive calling for a constitutional convention to rewrite the Michigan Constitution .\nRomney 's sales skills made Citizens for Michigan one of the most effective organizations among those calling for the convention .\nPreviously unaffiliated politically , Romney declared himself a member of the Republican Party and gained election to the convention .\nBy early 1960 , many in Michigan 's somewhat moribund Republican Party were touting Romney as a possible candidate for governor , U.S. senator , or even U.S. vice president .\nAlso in early 1960 , Romney served on the Fair Campaign Practices Committee , a group also having Jewish , Catholic , mainline and evangelical Protestant , and Orthodox Christian members .\nIt issued a report whose guiding principles were that no candidate for elected office should be supported or opposed due to their religion and that no campaign for office should be seen as an opportunity to vote for one religion against another .\nThis statement helped pave the way for John F. Kennedy 's famous speech on religion and public office later that year .\nRomney briefly considered a run in the 1960 Senate election , but instead became a vice president of the constitutional convention that revised the Michigan constitution during 1961 and 1962 .\n= = Governor of Michigan = =\nAfter a period of pained indecision and a 24-hour prayer fast , Romney stepped down from AMC in February 1962 to enter electoral politics ( given an indefinite leave of absence , he was succeeded as president of AMC by Roy Abernethy ) .\nRomney 's position as the leader of the moderate Republicans at the constitutional convention helped gain him the Republican nomination for Governor of Michigan .\nHe ran against incumbent Democratic Governor John B. Swainson in the general election .\nRomney campaigned on revising the state 's tax structure , increasing its appeal to businesses and the general public , and getting it \" rolling again \" .\nRomney decried both the large influence of labor unions within the Democratic Party and the similarly large influence of big business within the Republican Party .\nHis campaign was among the first to exploit the capabilities of electronic data processing .\nRomney won by some 80,000 votes and ended a fourteen-year stretch of Democratic rule in the state executive spot .\nHis win was attributed to his appeal to independent voters and to those from the increasingly influential suburbs of Detroit , who by 1962 were more likely to vote Republican than the heavily Democratic residents of the city itself .\nAdditionally , Romney had appeal to labor union members that was unusual for a Republican .\nDemocrats won all the other statewide executive offices in the election , including Democratic incumbent T. John Lesinski in the separate election for Lieutenant Governor of Michigan .\nRomney 's success caused immediate mention of him as a presidential possibility for 1964 , and President John F. Kennedy said privately in 1963 that , \" The one fellow I don 't want to run against is Romney . \"\nRomney was sworn in as governor on January 1 , 1963 .\nHis initial concern was the implementation of the overhaul of the state 's financial and revenue structure that had been authorized by the constitutional convention .\nIn 1963 , he proposed a comprehensive tax revision package that included a flat-rate state income tax , but general economic prosperity alleviated pressure on the state budget and the Michigan Legislature rejected the measure .\nRomney 's early difficulties with the legislature helped undermine an attempted push that year of Romney as a national political figure by former Richard Nixon associates .\nOne Michigan Democrat said of Romney , \" He has not yet learned that things in government are not necessarily done the moment the man at the top gives an order .\nHe is eager and sometimes impatient . \"\nBut over his first two years in office , Romney was able to work with Democrats \u2013 who often had at least partial control of the legislature \u2013 and an informal bipartisan coalition formed which allowed Romney to accomplish many of his goals and initiatives .\nRomney held a series of Governor 's Conferences , which sought to find new ideas from public services professionals and community activists who attended .\nHe opened his office in the Michigan State Capitol to visitors , spending five minutes with every citizen who wanted to speak with him on Thursday mornings , and was always sure to shake the hands of schoolchildren visiting the capitol .\nHe almost always eschewed political activities on Sunday , the Mormon Sabbath .\nHis blunt and unequivocal manner sometimes caused friction , and family members and associates used the idiom \" bull in a china shop \" to describe him .\nHe took a theatrical approach to governance , staging sudden appearances in settings where he might be politically unwelcome .\nOne former aide later said that willful was too weak a word to describe him , and chose messianic instead .\nRomney saw a moral dimension in every issue and his political views were held with as much fervor as religious ones ; writer Theodore H. White said \" the first quality that surfaced , as one met and talked with George Romney over a number of years , was a sincerity so profound that , in conversation , one was almost embarrassed . \"\nRomney supported the American Civil Rights Movement while governor .\nAlthough he belonged to a church that did not allow black people in its lay clergy , Romney 's hardscrabble background and subsequent life experiences led him to support the movement .\nHe reflected , \" It was only after I got to Detroit that I got to know Negroes and began to be able to evaluate them and I began to recognize that some Negroes are better and more capable than lots of whites . \"\nDuring his first State of the State address in January 1963 , Romney declared that \" Michigan 's most urgent human rights problem is racial discrimination \u2014 in housing , public accommodations , education , administration of justice , and employment . \"\nRomney helped create the state 's first civil rights commission .\nWhen Martin Luther King Jr .\ncame to Detroit in June 1963 and led the 120,000-strong Great March on Detroit , Romney designated the occasion Freedom March Day in Michigan , and sent state senator Stanley Thayer to march with King as his emissary , but did not attend himself because it was on Sunday .\nRomney did participate in a much smaller march protesting housing discrimination the following Saturday in Grosse Pointe , after King had left .\nRomney 's advocacy of civil rights brought him criticism from some in his own church ; in January 1964 , Quorum of the Twelve Apostles member Delbert L. Stapley wrote him that a proposed civil rights bill was \" vicious legislation \" and telling him that \" the Lord had placed the curse upon the Negro \" and men should not seek its removal .\nRomney refused to change his position and increased his efforts towards civil rights .\nRegarding the church policy itself , Romney was among those liberal Mormons who hoped the church leadership would revise the theological interpretation that underlay it , but Romney did not believe in publicly criticizing the church , subsequently saying that fellow Mormon Stewart Udall 's 1967 published denunciation of the policy \" cannot serve any useful religious purpose \" .\nIn the 1964 U.S. presidential election , Senator Barry Goldwater quickly became the likely Republican Party nominee .\nGoldwater represented a new wave of American conservatism , of which the moderate Romney was not a part .\nRomney also felt that Goldwater would be a drag on Republicans running in all the other races that year , including Romney 's own ( at the time , Michigan had two-year terms for its governor ) .\nFinally , Romney disagreed strongly with Goldwater 's views on civil rights ; he would later say , \" Whites and Negroes , in my opinion , have got to learn to know each other .\nBarry Goldwater didn 't have any background to understand this , to fathom them , and I couldn 't get through to him . \"\nDuring the June 1964 National Governors ' Conference , 13 of 16 Republican governors present were opposed to Goldwater ; their leaders were Jim Rhodes of Ohio , Nelson Rockefeller of New York ( whose own campaign had just stalled out with a loss to Goldwater in the California primary ) , William Scranton of Pennsylvania , and Romney .\nIn an unusual Sunday press conference , Romney declared , \" If [ Goldwater 's ] views deviate as indicated from the heritage of our party , I will do everything within my power to keep him from becoming the party 's presidential nominee . \"\nRomney had , however , previously vowed to Michigan voters that he would not run for president in 1964 .\nDetroit newspapers indicated they would not support him in any such bid , and Romney quickly decided to honor his pledge to stay out of the contest .\nScranton entered instead , but Goldwater prevailed decisively at the 1964 Republican National Convention .\nRomney 's name was entered into nomination as a favorite son by U.S . Representative Gerald Ford of Michigan ( who had not wanted to choose between candidates during the primary campaign ) and he received the votes of 41 delegates in the roll call ( 40 of Michigan 's 48 and one from Kansas ) .\nAt the convention , Romney fought for a strengthened civil rights plank in the party platform that would pledge action to eliminate discrimination at the state , local , and private levels , but it was defeated on a voice vote .\nHe also failed to win support for a statement that condemned both left- and right-wing extremism without naming any organizations , which lost a standing vote by a two-to-one margin .\nBoth of Romney 's positions were endorsed by former President Dwight Eisenhower , who had an approach to civic responsibilities similar to Romney 's .\nAs the convention concluded , Romney neither endorsed nor repudiated Goldwater and vice presidential nominee William E. Miller , saying he had reservations about Goldwater 's lack of support for civil rights and the political extremism that Goldwater embodied .\nFor the fall 1964 elections , Romney cut himself off from the national ticket , refusing to even appear on the same stage with them and continuing to feud with Goldwater privately .\nHe campaigned for governor in mostly Democratic areas , and when pressed at campaign appearances about whether he supported Goldwater , he replied , \" You know darn well I 'm not ! \"\nRomney was re-elected in 1964 by a margin of over 380,000 votes over Democratic Congressman Neil Staebler , despite Goldwater 's landslide defeat to President Lyndon B. Johnson that swept away many other Republican candidates .\nRomney won 15 percent of Michigan 's black vote , compared to Goldwater 's two percent .\nIn 1965 , Romney visited South Vietnam for 31 days and said that he was continuing his strong support for U.S. military involvement there .\nDuring 1966 , while son Mitt was away in France on missionary work , George Romney guided Mitt 's fianc\u00e9e Ann Davies in her conversion to Mormonism .\nGovernor Romney continued his support of civil rights ; after violence broke out during the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965 , he marched at the front of a Detroit parade in solidarity with the marchers .\nIn 1966 , Romney had his biggest electoral success , winning re-election again by some 527,000 votes over Democratic lawyer Zolton Ferency ( this time to a four-year term , after a change in Michigan law ) .\nHis share of the black vote rose to over 30 percent , a virtually unprecedented accomplishment for a Republican .\nBy 1967 , a looming deficit prompted the legislature to overhaul Michigan 's tax structure .\nPersonal and corporate state income taxes were created while business receipts and corporation franchise taxes were eliminated .\nPassage of an income levy had eluded past Michigan governors , no matter which party controlled of the legislature .\nRomney 's success convincing Democratic and Republican factions to compromise on the details of the measure was considered a key test of his political ability .\nThe massive 12th Street riot in Detroit began during the predawn hours of July 23 , 1967 , precipitated by a police raid of a speakeasy in a predominantly black neighborhood .\nAs the day wore on and looting and fires got worse , Romney called in the Michigan State Police and the Michigan National Guard .\nAt 3 a.m. on July 24 , Romney and Detroit Mayor Jerome Cavanagh called U.S . Attorney General Ramsey Clark and requested that federal troops be sent .\nClark indicated that to do so , Romney would have to declare a state of civil insurrection , which the governor was loath to do from fear that insurance companies would seize upon it as a reason to not cover losses owing to the riot .\nElements of the 82nd and 101st U.S . Army Airborne Divisions were mobilized outside of the city .\nAs the situation in Detroit worsened , Romney told Deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance , \" We gotta move , man , we gotta move . \"\nNear midnight on July 24 , President Johnson authorized thousands of paratroopers to enter Detroit .\nJohnson went on national television to announce his actions and made seven references to Romney 's inability to control the riot using state and local forces .\nThousands of arrests took place and the rioting continued until July 27 .\nThe final toll was the largest of any American civil disturbance in fifty years : 43 dead , over a thousand injured , 2,500 stores looted , hundreds of homes burned , and some $ 50 million overall in property damage .\nThere were strong political implications in the handling of the riot , as Romney was seen as a leading Republican contender to challenge Johnson 's presidential re-election the following year ; Romney believed the White House had intentionally slowed its response and he charged Johnson with having \" played politics \" in his actions .\nThe riot notwithstanding , by the end of Romney 's governorship the state had made strong gains in civil rights related to public employment , government contracting , and access to public accommodations .\nLesser improvements were made in combating discrimination in private employment , housing , education , and law enforcement .\nConsiderable state and federal efforts were made during this time to improve the lot of Michigan 's migrant farm workers and Native Americans , without much progress for either .\nRomney greatly expanded the size of state government while governor .\nHis first state budget , for fiscal year 1963 , was $ 550 million , a $ 20 million increase over that of his predecessor Swainson .\nRomney had also inherited an $ 85 million budget deficit , but left office with a surplus .\nIn the following fiscal years , the state budget increased to $ 684 million for 1964 , $ 820 million for 1965 , $ 1 billion for 1966 , $ 1.1 billion for 1967 , and was proposed as $ 1.3 billion for 1968 .\nRomney led the way for a large increase in state spending on education , and Michigan began to develop one of the nation 's most comprehensive systems of higher education .\nThere was a significant increase in funding support for local governments and there were generous benefits for the poor and unemployed .\nRomney 's spending was enabled by the post \u2013 World War II economic expansion that generated continued government surpluses and by a consensus of both parties in Michigan to maintain extensive state bureaucracies and expand public sector services .\nThe bipartisan coalitions that Romney worked with in the state legislature enabled him to reach most of his legislative goals .\nHis record as governor continued his reputation for having , as writer Theodore H. White said , \" a knack for getting things done . \"\nNoted University of Michigan historian Sidney Fine assessed him as \" a highly successful governor \" .\n= = 1968 presidential campaign = =\nRomney 's wide margin of re-election as governor in November 1966 thrust him to the forefront of national Republicans .\nIn addition to his political record , the tall , square-jawed , handsome , graying Romney matched what the public thought a president should look like .\nRepublican governors were determined not to let a Goldwater-sized loss recur , and neither Rockefeller nor Scranton wanted to run again ; the governors quickly settled on Romney as their favorite for the Republican presidential nomination in the 1968 U.S. presidential election .\nFormer Congressman and Republican National Committee chair Leonard W. Hall became Romney 's informal campaign manager .\nA Gallup Poll after the November elections showed Romney as favored among Republicans over former Vice President Richard Nixon for the Republican nomination , 39 percent to 31 percent ; a Harris Poll showed Romney besting President Johnson among all voters by 54 percent to 46 percent .\nNixon considered Romney his chief opponent .\nRomney announced an exploratory phase for a possible campaign in February 1967 , beginning with a visit to Alaska and the Rocky Mountain states .\nRomney 's greatest weakness was a lack of foreign policy expertise and a need for a clear position on the Vietnam War .\nThe press coverage of the trip focused on Vietnam and reporters were frustrated by Romney 's initial reluctance to speak about it .\nThe qualities that helped Romney as an industry executive worked against him as a presidential candidate ; he had difficulty being articulate , often speaking at length and too forthrightly on a topic and then later correcting himself while maintaining he was not .\nReporter Jack Germond joked that he was going to add a single key on his typewriter that would print , \" Romney later explained .... \" Life magazine wrote that Romney \" manages to turn self-expression into a positive ordeal \" and that he was no different in private : \" nobody can sound more like the public George Romney than the real George Romney let loose to ramble , inevitably away from the point and toward some distant moral precept . \"\nThe perception grew that Romney was gaffe-prone .\nThe campaign , beset by internal rivalries , soon went through the first of several reorganizations .\nBy then , Nixon had already overtaken Romney in Gallup 's Republican preference poll , a lead he would hold throughout the rest of the campaign .\nThe techniques that had brought Romney victories in Michigan , such as operating outside established partisan formulas and keeping a distance from Republican Party organizational elements , proved ineffective in a party nominating contest .\nRomney 's national poll ratings continued to erode , and by May he had lost his edge over Johnson .\nThe Detroit riots of July 1967 did not change his standing among Republicans , but did give him a bounce in national polls against the increasingly unpopular president .\nQuestions were occasionally asked about Romney 's eligibility to run for President owing to his birth in Mexico , given the ambiguity in the United States Constitution over the phrase \" natural-born citizen \" .\nRomney would depart the race before the matter could be more definitively resolved , although the preponderance of opinion then and since has been that he was eligible .\nRomney was also the first Mormon to stage a credible run for the presidency .\nBy this time , he was well known as a Mormon and perhaps the most nationally visible one since Brigham Young .\nBut his membership in the LDS Church was scarcely mentioned at all during the campaign .\nWhat indirect discussion there was helped bring to national attention the church 's policy regarding blacks , but the contrast of Romney 's pro-civil rights stance deflected any criticism of him and indirectly benefited the image of the church .\nSome historians and Mormons suspected then and later that had Romney 's campaign lasted longer and been more successful , his religion might have become a more prominent issue .\nRomney 's campaign did often focus on his core beliefs ; a Romney billboard in New Hampshire read \" The Way To Stop Crime Is To Stop Moral Decay \" .\nDartmouth College students gave a bemused reaction to his morals message , displaying signs such as \" God Is Alive and Thinks He 's George Romney \" .\nA spate of books were published about Romney , more than for any other candidate , and included a friendly campaign biography , an attack from a former staffer , and a collection of Romney 's speeches .\nOn August 31 , 1967 , in a taped interview with locally influential ( and nationally syndicated ) talk show host Lou Gordon of WKBD-TV in Detroit , Romney stated : \" When I came back from Viet Nam [ in November 1965 ] , I 'd just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get . \"\nHe then shifted to opposing the war : \" I no longer believe that it was necessary for us to get involved in South Vietnam to stop Communist aggression in Southeast Asia . \"\nDecrying the \" tragic \" conflict , he urged \" a sound peace in South Vietnam at an early time . \"\nThus Romney disavowed the war and reversed himself from his earlier stated belief that the war was \" morally right and necessary \" .\nThe \" brainwashing \" reference had been an offhand , unplanned remark that came at the end of a long , behind-schedule day of campaigning .\nBy September 7 , it found its way into prominence at The New York Times .\nEight other governors who had been on the same 1965 trip as Romney said no such activity had taken place , and one of them , Philip H. Hoff of Vermont , said Romney 's remarks were \" outrageous , kind of stinking ...\nEither he 's a most na\u00efve man or he lacks judgment . \"\nThe connotations of brainwashing , following the experiences of American prisoners of war ( highlighted by the 1962 film The Manchurian Candidate ) , made Romney 's comment devastating , especially as it reinforced the negative image of Romney 's abilities that had already developed .\nThe topic of brainwashing quickly became newspaper editorial and television talk show fodder , and Romney bore the brunt of the topical humor .\nSenator Eugene McCarthy , running against Johnson for the Democratic nomination , said that in Romney 's case , \" a light rinse would have been sufficient . \"\nRepublican Congressman Robert T. Stafford of Vermont sounded a common concern : \" If you 're running for the presidency , you are supposed to have too much on the ball to be brainwashed . \"\nAfter the remark was aired , Romney 's poll ratings nosedived , going from 11 percent behind Nixon to 26 percent behind .\nHe nonetheless persevered , staging a three-week , 17-city tour of the nation 's ghettos and disadvantaged areas that none of his advisors thought politically worthwhile .\nHe sought to engage militants in dialogue , found himself exposed to the harsh realities and language of ghetto areas , and had an unusual encounter with hippies and The Diggers in San Francisco 's Haight-Ashbury .\nRomney formally announced on November 18 , 1967 , at Detroit 's Veterans Memorial Building , that he had \" decided to fight for and win the Republican nomination and election to the Presidency of the United States . \"\nHis subsequent release of his federal tax returns \u2013 twelve years ' worth going back to his time as AMC head \u2013 was groundbreaking and established a precedent that many future presidential candidates would have to contend with .\nHe spent the following months campaigning tirelessly , focusing on the New Hampshire primary , the first of the season , and doing all the on-the-ground activities known to that state : greeting workers at factory gates before dawn , having neighborhood meetings in private homes , and stopping at bowling alleys .\nHe returned to Vietnam in December 1967 and made speeches and proposals on the subject , one of which presaged Nixon 's eventual policy of Vietnamization .\nFor a while , he got an improved response from voters .\nTwo weeks before the March 12 primary , an internal poll showed Romney losing to Nixon by a six-to-one margin in New Hampshire .\nRockefeller , seeing the poll result as well , publicly maintained his support for Romney but said he would be available for a draft ; the statement made national headlines and embittered Romney ( who would later claim it was Rockefeller 's entry , and not the \" brainwashing \" remark , that doomed him ) .\nSeeing his cause was hopeless , Romney announced his withdrawal as a presidential candidate on February 28 , 1968 .\nRomney wrote his son Mitt , still away on missionary work : \" Your mother and I are not personally distressed .\nAs a matter of fact , we are relieved .\n...\nI aspired , and though I achieved not , I am satisfied . \"\nNixon went on to gain the nomination .\nAt the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach , Romney refused to release his delegates to Nixon , something Nixon did not forget .\nRomney finished a weak fifth , with only 50 votes on the roll call ( 44 of Michigan 's 48 , plus six from Utah ) .\nWhen party liberals and moderates and others expressed dismay at Nixon 's choice of Spiro Agnew as his running mate , Romney 's name was placed into nomination for vice president by Mayor of New York John Lindsay and pushed by several delegations .\nRomney said he did not initiate the move , but he made no effort to oppose it .\nNixon saw the rebellion as a threat to his leadership and actively fought against it ; Romney lost to Agnew 1,119 \u2013 186 .\nRomney , however , worked for Nixon 's eventually successful campaign in the fall , which did earn him Nixon 's gratitude .\nPresidential historian Theodore H. White wrote that during his campaign Romney gave \" the impression of an honest and decent man simply not cut out to be President of the United States . \"\nGovernor Jim Rhodes of Ohio more memorably said , \" Watching George Romney run for the presidency was like watching a duck try to make love to a football . \"\n= = Secretary of Housing and Urban Development = =\nAfter the election , Nixon named Romney to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) .\nThe president-elect made the announcement as part of a nationally televised presentation of his new cabinet on December 11 , 1968 .\nNixon praised Romney for his \" missionary zeal \" and said that he would also be tasked with mobilizing volunteer organizations to fight poverty and disease within the United States .\nIn actuality , Nixon distrusted Romney politically , and appointed him to a liberally oriented , low-profile federal agency partly to appease Republican moderates and partly to reduce Romney 's potential to challenge for the 1972 Republican presidential nomination .\nRomney was confirmed by the Senate without opposition on January 20 , 1969 , the day of Nixon 's inauguration , and was sworn into office on January 22 , with Nixon at his side .\nRomney resigned as Governor of Michigan that same day , and was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor William G. Milliken .\nMilliken continued Romney 's model of downplaying party label and ideology , and Republicans held onto the governorship for three more terms until 1983 , though Michigan was one of the nation 's most blue-collar states .\nAs secretary , Romney conducted the first reorganization of the department since its 1966 creation .\nHis November 1969 plan brought programs with similar functions together under unified , policy-based administration at the Washington level , and created two new assistant secretary positions .\nAt the same time , he increased the number of regional and area offices and decentralized program operations and locality-based decisions to them .\nThe Fair Housing Act of 1968 mandated a federal commitment towards housing desegregation , and required HUD to orient its programs in this direction .\nRomney , filled with moral passion , wanted to address the widening economic and geographic gulf between whites and blacks by moving blacks out of inner-city ghettos into suburbs .\nRomney proposed an open housing scheme to facilitate desegregation , dubbed \" Open Communities \" ; HUD planned it for many months without keeping Nixon informed .\nWhen the open housing proposal became public , local reaction was often hostile .\nSuch was the reaction of many residents in Warren , Michigan , a predominately white blue-collar suburb of Detroit .\nWhile it had no formal discriminatory laws , most blacks were excluded by zoning practices , refusals to sell to them , and intimidatory actions of white property owners , many of whom were ethnic Polish and Catholic and had moved to the suburb as part of white flight .\nBy this time , Detroit was 40 \u2013 50 percent black .\nHUD made Warren a prime target for Open Communities enforcement and threatened to halt all federal assistance to the town unless it took a series of actions to end racial discrimination there ; town officials said progress was being made and that their citizens resented forced integration .\nRomney rejected this response , partly because when he was governor , Warren residents had thrown rocks and garbage and yelled obscenities for days at a biracial couple who moved into town .\nNow the secretary said , \" The youth of this nation , the minorities of this nation , the discriminated of this nation are not going to wait for ' nature to take its course.'\nWhat is really at issue here is responsibility \u2013 moral responsibility . \"\nRomney visited Warren in July 1970 , where he addressed leaders from it and around 40 nearby suburbs .\nHe emphasized that the government was encouraging affirmative action rather than forced integration , but the local populace saw little difference and Romney was jeered as a police escort took him away from the meeting place .\nNixon saw what happened in Warren and had no interest in the Open Communities policy in general , remarking to domestic adviser John Ehrlichman that , \" This country is not ready at this time for either forcibly integrated housing or forcibly integrated education . \"\nThe Open Communities policy conflicted with Nixon 's use of the Southern strategy of gaining political support among traditionally white southern Democrats , and his own views on race .\nRomney was forced to back down on Warren and release federal monies to them unconditionally .\nWhen Black Jack , Missouri , subsequently resisted a HUD-sponsored plan for desegregated lower- and middle-income housing , Romney appealed to U.S . Attorney General John Mitchell for Justice Department intervention .\nIn September 1970 , Mitchell refused and Romney 's plan collapsed .\nUnder Romney , HUD did establish stricter affirmative racial guidelines in relation to new public housing projects , but overall administration implementation of the Fair Housing Act was lacking .\nSome of the responsibility lay with Romney 's inattentiveness to gaining political backing for the policy , including the failure to rally natural allies such as the NAACP .\nSalisbury University historian Dean J. Kotlowski writes that , \" No civil rights initiative developed on Nixon 's watch was as sincerely devised or poorly executed as open communities . \"\nAnother of Romney 's initiatives was \" Operation Breakthrough , \" which was intended to increase the amount of housing available to the poor and which initially had Nixon 's support .\nBased on his automotive industry experience , Romney thought that the cost of housing could be significantly reduced if in-factory modular construction techniques were used .\nHUD officials believed that introduction of this technique could help bring about desegregation ; Romney said , \" We 've got to put an end to the idea of moving to suburban areas and living only among people of the same economic and social class \" .\nThis aspect of the program brought about strong opposition at the local suburban level and lost support in the White House as well .\nOver half of HUD 's research funds during this time were spent on Operation Breakthrough , and it was modestly successful in its building goals .\nIt did not revolutionize home construction , and was phased out once Romney left HUD .\nBut it resulted indirectly in more modern and consistent building codes and introduction of technological advances such as the smoke alarm .\nIn any case , using conventional construction methods , HUD set records for the amount of construction of assisted housing for low- and moderate-income families .\nToward the end of his term , Romney oversaw demolition of the infamous Pruitt \u2013 Igoe housing project in St. Louis , which had become crime-ridden , drug-infested , and largely vacant .\nRomney was largely outside the president 's inner circle and had minimal influence within the Nixon administration .\nHis intense , sometimes bombastic style of making bold advances and awkward pullbacks lacked adequate guile to succeed in Washington .\nDesegregation efforts in employment and education had more success than in housing during the Nixon administration , but HUD 's many missions and unwieldy structure , which sometimes worked at cross-purposes , made it institutionally vulnerable to political attack .\nRomney also failed to understand or circumvent Nixon 's use of counsel Ehrlichman and White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman as policy gatekeepers , resulting in de facto downgrading of the power of cabinet officers .\nRomney was used to being listened to and making his own decisions ; he annoyed Nixon by casually interrupting him at meetings .\nAt one point , Nixon told Haldeman , \" Just keep [ Romney ] away from me . \"\nA statement by Romney that he would voluntarily reduce his salary to aid the federal budget was viewed by Nixon as an \" ineffective grandstand play \" .\nBy early 1970 , Nixon had decided he wanted Romney removed from his position .\nNixon , who hated to fire people and was , as Ehrlichman later described , \" notoriously inadept \" at it , instead hatched a plot to get Romney to run in the 1970 U.S . Senate race in Michigan .\nInstead , Romney proposed that his wife Lenore run , and she received the backing of some state Republicans .\nThere was also resistance to her candidacy and an initial suspicion that it was just a stalking horse for keeping his options open .\nShe barely survived a primary against a conservative opponent , then lost badly in the general election to incumbent Democrat Philip A. Hart .\nRomney blamed others for his wife having entered the race , when he had been the major force behind it .\nIn late 1970 , after opposition to Open Communities reached a peak , Nixon again decided that Romney should go .\nStill reluctant to dismiss him , Nixon tried to get Romney to resign by forcing him to capitulate on a series of policy issues .\nRomney surprised both Nixon and Haldeman by agreeing to back off his positions , and Nixon kept him as HUD secretary .\nNixon remarked privately afterwards , \" [ Romney ] talks big but folds under pressure . \"\nPuzzled by Nixon 's lack of apparent ideological consistency across different areas of the government , Romney told a friend , \" I don 't know what the president believes in .\nMaybe he doesn 't believe in anything , \" an assessment shared by others both inside and outside the administration .\nIn spring 1972 , the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) , an agency within HUD , was struck by scandal .\nSince passage of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 and the creation of the Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ) , it had been responsible for helping the poor buy homes in inner-city areas via government-backed mortgages .\nThese were financed by mortgage-backed securities , the first issues of which Romney had announced in 1970 .\nA number of FHA employees , along with a number of real estate firms and lawyers , were indicted for a scheme in which the value of cheap inner city homes was inflated and they were sold to black buyers who could not really afford them , based on using those government-backed mortgages .\nThe government was stuck for the bad loans when owners defaulted , as the properties were overvalued and could not be resold at the inflated prices .\nRomney conceded that HUD had been unprepared to deal with speculators and had not been alert to earlier signs of illegal activity at the FHA .\nThe FHA scandal gave Nixon the ability to shut down HUD 's remaining desegregation efforts with little political risk ; by January 1973 , all federal housing funds had been frozen .\nIn August 1972 , Nixon announced Romney would inspect Hurricane Agnes flood damage in Wilkes-Barre , Pennsylvania , but neglected to tell Romney first .\nMuch of the area lacked shelter six weeks after the storm , residents were angry , and Romney got into a three-way shouting match with Governor Milton J. Shapp and a local citizens ' representative .\nRomney denounced Shapp 's proposal that the federal government pay off the mortgages of victims as \" unrealistic and demagogic \" , and the representative angrily said to Romney , \" You don 't give a damn whether we live or die . \"\nThe confrontation received wide media attention , damaging Romney 's public reputation .\nFeeling very frustrated , Romney wanted to resign immediately , but Nixon , worried about the fallout to his 1972 re-election campaign , insisted that Romney stay on .\nRomney agreed , although he indicated to the press that he would leave eventually .\nRomney finally turned in his resignation on November 9 , 1972 , following Nixon 's re-election .\nHis departure was announced on November 27 , 1972 , as part of the initial wave of departures from Nixon 's first-term cabinet .\nRomney said he was unhappy with presidential candidates who declined to address \" the real issues \" facing the nation for fear they would lose votes , and said he would form a new national citizens ' organization that would attempt to enlighten the public on the most vital topics .\nHe added that he would stay on as secretary until his successor could be appointed and confirmed , and did stay until Nixon 's second inauguration on January 20 , 1973 .\nUpon his departure , Romney said he looked forward \" with great enthusiasm \" to his return to private life .\nThe Boston Globe later termed Romney 's conflicts with Nixon a matter that \" played out with Shakespearean drama \" .\nDespite all the setbacks and frustrations , University at Buffalo political scientist Charles M. Lamb concluded that Romney pressed harder to achieve suburban integration than any prominent federal official in the ensuing 1970s through the 1990s .\nIn 2008 , Lehman College sociology professor Christopher Bonastia assessed the Romney-era HUD as having come \" surprisingly close to implementing unpopular antidiscrimination policies \" but finally being unable to produce meaningful alterations in American residential segregation patterns , with no equivalent effort having happened since then or likely to in the foreseeable future .\n= = Public service , volunteerism , and final years = =\nRomney was known as an advocate of public service , and volunteerism was a passion of his .\nHe initiated several volunteer programs while Governor of Michigan , and at the beginning of the Nixon administration chaired the Cabinet Committee on Voluntary Action .\nOut of this the National Center for Voluntary Action was created : an independent , private , non-profit organization intended to encourage volunteerism on the part of American citizens and organizations , to assist in program development for voluntary efforts , and to make voluntary action an important force in American society .\nRomney 's long interest in volunteerism stemmed from the Mormon belief in the power of institutions to transform the individual , but also had a secular basis .\nAt the National Center 's first meeting on February 20 , 1970 , he said :\nAmericans have four basic ways of solving problems that are too big for individuals to handle by themselves .\nOne is through the federal government .\nA second is through state governments and the local governments that the states create .\nThe third is through the private sector \u2013 the economic sector that includes business , agriculture , and labor .\nThe fourth method is the independent sector \u2013 the voluntary , cooperative action of free individuals and independent association .\nVoluntary action is the most powerful of these , because it is uniquely capable of stirring the people themselves and involving their enthusiastic energies , because it is their own \u2013 voluntary action is the people 's action .\n... As Woodrow Wilson said , \" The most powerful force on earth is the spontaneous cooperation of a free people . \"\nIndividualism makes cooperation worthwhile \u2013 but cooperation makes freedom possible .\nIn 1973 , after he left the cabinet , Romney became chair and CEO of the National Center for Voluntary Action .\nIn 1979 , this organization merged with the Colorado-based National Information Center on Volunteerism and became known as VOLUNTEER : The National Center for Citizen Involvement ; Romney headed the new organization .\nThe organization simplified its name to VOLUNTEER : The National Center in 1984 and to the National Volunteer Center in 1990 .\nRomney remained as chair of these organizations throughout this time .\nWithin the LDS Church , Romney remained active and prominent , serving as patriarch of the Bloomfield Hills Stake and holding the office of regional representative of the Twelve , covering Michigan and northern Ohio .\nAs part of a longtime habit of playing golf daily , he had long ago concocted a \" compact 18 \" format in which he played three balls on each of six holes , or similar formulations depending upon the amount of daylight .\nDuring the early part of the Reagan administration , Romney served on the President 's Task Force for Private Sector Initiatives along with LDS leader Monson .\nIn 1987 , he held a four-generation extended family reunion in Washington , where he showed the places and recounted the events of his life which had occurred there .\nLooking back on his and some other failed presidential bids , he once concluded , \" You can 't be right too soon and win elections . \"\nPresident George H. W. Bush 's Points of Light Foundation was created in 1990 , also to encourage volunteerism .\nRomney received the Points of Light Foundation 's inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award from President Bush in April 1991 .\nThe Bush administration wanted to tap Romney to chair the new foundation , but he reportedly refused to head two organizations doing the same thing and suggested they merge .\nThey did so in September 1991 , and Romney became one of the founding directors of the Points of Light Foundation & Volunteer Center National Network .\nIn the early 1990s , Romney was also involved in helping to set up the Commission on National and Community Service , one of the predecessors to the later Corporation for National and Community Service .\nHe gave speeches emphasizing the vital role of people helping people , and in 1993 inspired the first national meeting of volunteer centers .\nFor much of his final two decades , Romney had been out of the political eye , but he re-emerged to the general public when he campaigned for his son , Mitt Romney , during the younger Romney 's bid to unseat Senator Edward M. Kennedy in the 1994 U.S . Senate election in Massachusetts .\nRomney had urged Mitt to enter the race and moved into his son 's house for its duration , serving as an unofficial advisor .\nRomney was a vigorous surrogate for his son in public appearances and at fundraising events .\nWhen Kennedy 's campaign sought to bring up the LDS Church 's past policy on blacks , Romney interrupted Mitt 's press conference and said loudly , \" I think it is absolutely wrong to keep hammering on the religious issues .\nAnd what Ted is trying to do is bring it into the picture . \"\nThe father counseled the son to be relaxed in appearance and to pay less attention to his political consultants and more to his own instincts , a change that the younger Romney made late in the ultimately unsuccessful campaign .\nThat same year , Ronna Romney , Romney 's ex-daughter-in-law ( formerly married to G. Scott Romney ) , decided to seek the Republican nomination for the U.S . Senate from Michigan .\nWhile Mitt and G. Scott endorsed Ronna Romney , George Romney had endorsed her opponent and the eventual winner , Spencer Abraham , during the previous year when Ronna was considering a run but had not yet announced .\nA family spokesperson said that George Romney had endorsed Abraham before knowing Ronna Romney would run and could not go back on his word , although he did refrain from personally campaigning on Abraham 's behalf .\nBy January 1995 , amid press criticism of the Points of Light Foundation engaging in ineffective , wasteful spending , Romney expressed concern that the organization had too high a budget .\nActive to the end , in July 1995 , four days before his death , Romney proposed a presidential summit to encourage greater volunteerism and community service , and the night before his death he drove to a meeting of another volunteer organization .\nOn July 26 , 1995 , Romney died of a heart attack at the age of 88 while he was doing his morning exercising on a treadmill at his home in Bloomfield Hills , Michigan ; he was discovered by his wife Lenore but it was too late to save him .\nHe was buried at the Fairview Cemetery in Brighton , Michigan .\nIn addition to his wife and children , Romney was survived by 23 grandchildren and 33 great-grandchildren .\n= = Legacy = =\nThe Presidents ' Summit For America 's Future took place in Philadelphia in 1997 , manifesting Romney 's last volunteerism proposal , with the organization America 's Promise coming out of it .\nFor many years , the Points of Light Foundation ( and its predecessor organization ) has given out an annual Lenore and George W. Romney Citizen Volunteer Award ( later retitled the George and Lenore Romney Citizen Volunteer Award ) ; the inaugural such award in 1987 went to George Romney himself .\nThe Points of Light Foundation and the Corporation for National and Community Service also give out a George W. Romney Volunteer Center Excellence Award ( later the George W. Romney Excellence Award ) at the annual National Conference on Community Volunteering and National Service ( later the National Conference on Volunteering and Service ) .\nThe George W. Romney Volunteer Center itself is sponsored by the United Way for Southeastern Michigan , and began during Romney 's lifetime .\nFounded in 1998 with a grant from Romney 's immediate family , the George W. Romney Institute of Public Management in the Marriott School of Management at Brigham Young University honors the legacy left by Romney .\nIts mission is to develop people of high character who are committed to service , management , and leadership in the public sector and in non-profit organizations throughout the world .\nThe building housing the main offices of the Governor of Michigan in Lansing is known as the George W. Romney Building following a 1997 renaming .\nThe Governor George Romney Lifetime Achievement Award is given annually by the State of Michigan , to recognize citizens who have demonstrated a commitment to community involvement and volunteer service throughout their lifetimes .\nIn 2010 , Adrian College in Michigan announced the opening of its George Romney Institute for Law and Public Policy .\nIts purpose is to explore the interdisciplinary nature of law and public policy and encourage practitioners , academics , and students to work together on issues in this realm .\n= = Authored books = =\n*\n* ( Galley proofs produced , but prepress process ceased before actual publication )\n= = See also = =\n* List of U.S. state governors born outside the United States\n= = References = =\n= = Bibliography = =\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n= = Further reading = =\n*\n*\n*\n= = External links = =\n*\n*\n* George W.

        "article":"Lyndon Baines Johnson ( ; August 27 , 1908January 22 , 1973 ) , often referred to by his initials LBJ , was an American politician who served as the 36th President of the United States from 1963 to 1969 , assuming the office after having served as the 37th Vice President of the United States from 1961 to 1963 .\nA Democrat from Texas , he also served as a United States Representative and as the Majority Leader in the United States Senate .\nJohnson is one of only four people who have served in all four federal elected positions .\nBorn in a farmhouse in Stonewall , Texas , Johnson was a high school teacher and worked as a Congressional aide before winning election to the House of Representatives in 1937 .\nHe won election to the Senate in 1948 , and was appointed the position of Senate Majority Whip in 1951 .\nHe became the Senate Minority Leader in 1953 and the Senate Majority Leader in 1955 .\nAs a leader in the Senate , Johnson became known for his domineering personality and the \" Johnson treatment \" , his aggressive coercion of powerful politicians to advance legislation .\nJohnson ran for the Democratic nomination in the 1960 presidential election .\nAlthough unsuccessful , he accepted the invitation of then-Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts to be his running mate .\nThey went on to win a close election over the Republican ticket of Richard Nixon and Henry Cabot Lodge Jr . , and Johnson was sworn in as Vice President on January 20 , 1961 .\nOn November 22 , 1963 , Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas , Texas , and Johnson succeeded Kennedy as president .\nThe following year , Johnson won a landslide in 1964 , defeating Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona .\nIn domestic policy , Johnson designed the \" Great Society \" legislation by expanding civil rights , public broadcasting , Medicare , Medicaid , aid to education , the arts , urban and rural development , public services , and his \" War on Poverty \" .\nAssisted in part by a growing economy , the War on Poverty helped millions of Americans rise above the poverty line during his administration .\nCivil-rights bills that he signed into law banned racial discrimination in public facilities , interstate commerce , the workplace , and housing ; the Voting Rights Act prohibited certain requirements in southern states used to disenfranchise African Americans .\nWith the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 , the country 's immigration system was reformed , encouraging greater immigration from regions other than Europe .\nJohnson 's presidency marked the peak of modern liberalism after the New Deal era .\nIn foreign policy , Johnson escalated American involvement in the Vietnam War .\nIn 1964 , Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution , which granted Johnson the power to use military force in Southeast Asia without having to ask for an official declaration of war .\nThe number of American military personnel in Vietnam increased dramatically , from 16,000 advisors in non-combat roles in 1963 to 525,000 in 1967 , many in combat roles .\nAmerican casualties soared , and the peace process became bogged-down .\nGrowing unease with the war stimulated a large , angry anti-war movement based chiefly on university campuses .\nJohnson faced further troubles when summer riots broke out in most major cities after 1965 , and crime rates soared , as his opponents raised demands for \" law and order \" policies .\nWhile Johnson began his presidency with widespread approval , support for him declined as the public became upset with both the war and the growing violence at home .\nIn 1968 , the Democratic Party factionalized as anti-war elements denounced Johnson ; he ended his bid for renomination after a disappointing finish in the New Hampshire primary .\nNixon was elected to succeed him , as the New Deal coalition that had dominated presidential politics for 36 years collapsed .\nAfter he left office in January 1969 , Johnson returned to his Texas ranch , where he died of a heart attack at age 64 on January 22 , 1973 .\nJohnson is ranked favorably by many historians because of his domestic policies and the passage of many major laws that affected civil rights , gun control , wilderness preservation , and Social Security , although he has also drawn substantial criticism for his handling of the Vietnam War .\n= = Early years = =\nLyndon Baines Johnson was born on August 27 , 1908 , near Stonewall , Texas , in a small farmhouse on the Pedernales River .\nHe was the oldest of five children born to Samuel Ealy Johnson Jr .\nand Rebekah Baines .\nJohnson had one brother , Sam Houston Johnson , and three sisters ; Rebekah , Josefa , and Lucia .\nThe nearby small town of Johnson City , Texas , was named after LBJ 's cousin , James Polk Johnson , whose forebears had moved west from Georgia .\nJohnson had English , German , and Ulster Scots ancestry .\nHis patrilineal descent traces back to John Johnson , born in Dumfriesshire , Scotland in 1590 .\nHe was maternally descended from pioneer Baptist clergyman George Washington Baines , who pastored eight churches in Texas , as well as others in Arkansas and Louisiana .\nBaines , the grandfather of Johnson 's mother , was also the president of Baylor University during the American Civil War .\nJohnson 's grandfather , Samuel Ealy Johnson Sr. , was raised as a Baptist , and for a time was a member of the Christian Church ( Disciples of Christ ) .\nIn his later years the grandfather became a Christadelphian ; Johnson 's father also joined the Christadelphian Church toward the end of his life .\nLater , as a politician , Johnson was influenced in his positive attitude toward Jews by the religious beliefs that his family , especially his grandfather , had shared with him ( see Operation Texas ) .\nJohnson 's favorite Bible verse came from the King James Version of Isaiah 1 : 18 .\n\" Come now , and let us reason together ... \"\nIn school , Johnson was an awkward , talkative youth and was elected president of his 11th-grade class .\nHe graduated in 1924 from Johnson City High School , where he participated in public speaking , debate , and baseball .\nAt age 15 , Johnson was the youngest member of his class .\nPressured by his parents to attend college , he enrolled at a \" subcollege \" of Southwest Texas State Teachers College ( SWTSTC ) in the summer of 1924 , where students from unaccredited high schools could take the 12th-grade courses needed for admission to college .\nHe left the school just weeks after his arrival , and decided to move to Southern California .\nHe worked at his cousin 's legal practice and in various odd jobs before returning to Texas , where he worked as a day laborer .\nIn 1926 , Johnson managed to enroll at SWTSTC ( now Texas State University ) .\nHe worked his way through school , participated in debate and campus politics , and edited the school newspaper , The College Star .\nThe college years refined his skills of persuasion and political organization .\nFor nine months , from 1928 to 1929 , Johnson paused his studies to teach Mexican-American children at the segregated Welhausen School in Cotulla , some south of San Antonio in La Salle County .\nThe job helped him to save money to complete his education , and he graduated in 1930 .\nHe briefly taught at Pearsall High School before taking a position as teacher of public speaking at Sam Houston High School in Houston .\nWhen he returned to San Marcos in 1965 , after signing the Higher Education Act of 1965 , Johnson reminisced :\n= = Entry into politics = =\nAfter Richard M. Kleberg won a 1931 special election to represent Texas in the United States House of Representatives , he appointed Johnson as his legislative secretary .\nJohnson got the position on the recommendation of his own father and that of State Senator Welly Hopkins , who Johnson had campaigned for in 1930 .\nKleberg had little interest in performing the day-to-day duties of a Congressman , instead delegating them to Johnson .\nAfter Franklin D. Roosevelt won the 1932 presidential election , Johnson became a staunch supporter of Roosevelt 's New Deal .\nJohnson was elected speaker of the \" Little Congress , \" a group of Congressional aides , where he cultivated Congressmen , newspapermen , and lobbyists .\nJohnson 's friends soon included aides to President Roosevelt as well as fellow Texans such as Vice President John Nance Garner and Congressman Sam Rayburn .\nJohnson married Claudia Alta Taylor , also known as \" Lady Bird \" , of Karnack , Texas on November 17 , 1934 , after he attended Georgetown University Law Center for several months .\nThe wedding was officiated by Rev.\nArthur R. McKinstry at St. Mark 's Episcopal Church in San Antonio .\nThey had two daughters , Lynda Bird , born in 1944 , and Luci Baines , born in 1947 .\nJohnson gave his children names with the LBJ initials ; his dog was Little Beagle Johnson .\nHis was the LBJ Ranch ; his initials were on his cufflinks , ashtrays , and clothes .\nIn 1935 , he was appointed head of the Texas National Youth Administration , which enabled him to use the government to create education and job opportunities for young people .\nHe resigned two years later to run for Congress .\nJohnson , a notoriously tough boss throughout his career , often demanded long workdays and work on weekends .\nHe was described by friends , fellow politicians , and historians as motivated by an exceptional lust for power and control .\nAs Johnson 's biographer Robert Caro observes , \" Johnson 's ambition was uncommon \u2014 in the degree to which it was unencumbered by even the slightest excess weight of ideology , of philosophy , of principles , of beliefs . \"\n= = Career in U.S . House of Representatives ( 1937 \u2013 1949 ) = =\nIn 1937 , Johnson successfully campaigned in a special election for Texas 's 10th congressional district , that covered Austin and the surrounding hill country .\nHe ran on a New Deal platform and was effectively aided by his wife .\nHe served in the House from April 10 , 1937 , to January 3 , 1949 .\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt found Johnson to be a welcome ally and conduit for information , particularly with regard to issues concerning internal politics in Texas ( Operation Texas ) and the machinations of Vice President John Nance Garner and Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn .\nJohnson was immediately appointed to the Naval Affairs Committee .\nHe worked for rural electrification and other improvements for his district .\nJohnson steered the projects towards contractors that he personally knew , such as the Brown Brothers , Herman and George , who would finance much of Johnson 's future career .\nIn 1941 , he ran for the Democratic U.S . Senate nomination in a special election ; his main opponent was the sitting Governor of Texas , businessman and radio personality W. Lee O 'Daniel ; Johnson narrowly lost the Democratic primary , which was then tantamount to election , with O 'Daniel receiving 175,590 votes ( 30.49 % ) , and Johnson 174,279 ( 30.26 % ) .\n= = = Active military duty ( 1941 \u2013 1942 ) = = =\nJohnson was appointed a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S . Naval Reserve on June 21 , 1940 .\nWhile serving as a U.S. congressman , he was called to active duty three days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 .\nHis orders were to report to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington , D.C. for instruction and training .\nFollowing his training , he asked Undersecretary of the Navy James Forrestal for a combat assignment .\nHe was sent instead to inspect the shipyard facilities in Texas and on the West Coast .\nIn the spring of 1942 , President Roosevelt needed his own reports on what conditions were like in the Southwest Pacific .\nRoosevelt felt that information which flowed up the military chain of command needed to get delivered by a highly trusted political aide .\nFrom a suggestion by Forrestal , Roosevelt assigned Johnson to a three-man survey team of the Southwest Pacific .\nJohnson reported to General Douglas MacArthur in Australia .\nJohnson and two U.S . Army officers went to the 22nd Bomb Group base , which was assigned the high risk mission of bombing the Japanese airbase at Lae in New Guinea .\nJohnson 's roommate was an army second lieutenant who was a B-17 bomber pilot .\nOn June 9 , 1942 , Johnson volunteered as an observer for an air strike mission on New Guinea by eleven B-26 bombers that included his roommate in another plane .\nWhile on the mission , his roommate and his crew 's B-26 bomber was shot down with none of the eight men surviving the crash into the water .\nReports vary on what happened to the B-26 bomber carrying Johnson during that mission .\nJohnson 's biographer Robert Caro accepts Johnson 's account , and supports it with testimony from the aircrew concerned : the aircraft was attacked , disabling one engine , and it turned back before reaching its objective , though remaining under heavy fire .\nOthers claim that it turned back because of generator trouble before reaching the objective and before encountering enemy aircraft and never came under fire .\nThis is supported by official flight records .\nOther airplanes that continued to the target came under fire near the target at about the same time that Johnson 's plane was recorded as having landed back at the original airbase .\nMacArthur recommended Johnson for the Silver Star for gallantry in action : the only member of the crew to receive a decoration .\nAfter it was approved by the army , he personally presented the medal to Johnson , with the following citation :\nJohnson who had used a camera as an observer , reported to Roosevelt , to the Navy leaders , and to Congress that conditions were deplorable and unacceptable : some historians have suggested this was in exchange for MacArthur 's recommending of a Silver Star for him .\nHe argued that the South West Pacific urgently needed a higher priority and a larger share of war supplies .\nThe warplanes sent there , for example , were \" far inferior \" to Japanese planes , and morale was bad .\nHe told Forrestal that the Pacific Fleet had a \" critical \" need for 6,800 additional experienced men .\nJohnson prepared a twelve-point program to upgrade the effort in the region , stressing \" greater cooperation and coordination within the various commands and between the different war theaters . \"\nCongress responded by making Johnson chairman of a high-powered subcommittee of the Naval Affairs Committee , with a mission similar to that of the Truman Committee in the Senate .\nHe probed the peacetime \" business as usual \" inefficiencies that permeated the naval war and demanded that admirals shape up and get the job done .\nJohnson went too far when he proposed a bill that would crack down on the draft exemptions of shipyard workers if they were absent from work too often ; organized labor blocked the bill and denounced him .\nJohnson 's biographer , Robert Dallek concludes , \" The mission was a temporary exposure to danger calculated to satisfy Johnson 's personal and political wishes , but it also represented a genuine effort on his part , however misplaced , to improve the lot of America 's fighting men . \"\nIn addition to the Silver Star , Johnson received the American Campaign Medal , Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal , and the World War II Victory Medal .\nHe was released from active duty on July 17 , 1942 and remained in the Navy Reserve , later promoted to commander on October 19 , 1949 ( effective June 2 , 1948 ) .\nHe resigned from the Navy Reserve effective January 18 , 1964 .\n= = Career in U.S .

Eisenhower worked well together in passing Eisenhower 's domestic and foreign agenda .\nDuring the Suez Crisis , Johnson tried to prevent the US government from criticizing the Israeli invasion of the Sinai peninsula .\nAlong with the rest of the nation , Johnson was appalled by the threat of possible Soviet domination of space flight implied by the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite Sputnik 1 , and used his influence to ensure passage of the 1958 National Aeronautics and Space Act , which established the civilian space agency NASA .\nHistorians Caro and Dallek consider Lyndon Johnson the most effective Senate majority leader in history .\nHe was unusually proficient at gathering information .\nOne biographer suggests he was \" the greatest intelligence gatherer Washington has ever known \" , discovering exactly where every Senator stood on issues , his philosophy and prejudices , his strengths and weaknesses and what it took to get his vote .\nRobert Baker claimed that Johnson would occasionally send senators on NATO trips in order to avoid their dissenting votes .\nCentral to Johnson 's control was \" The Treatment \" , described by two journalists :\nA 60-cigarette-per-day smoker , Johnson suffered a near-fatal heart attack on July 2 , 1955 .\nHe abruptly gave up smoking as a result , with only a couple of exceptions , and did not resume the habit until he left the White House on January 20 , 1969 .\nJohnson announced he would remain as his party 's leader in the Senate on New Year 's Eve 1955 , his doctors reporting he had made \" a most satisfactory recovery \" since his heart attack five months prior .\n= = Campaigns of 1960 = =\nJohnson 's success in the Senate rendered him a potential Democratic presidential candidate ; he had been the \" favorite son \" candidate of the Texas delegation at the Party 's national convention in 1956 , and appeared to be in a strong position to run for the 1960 nomination .\nJim Rowe repeatedly urged Johnson to launch a campaign in early 1959 , but Johnson thought it better to wait , thinking that John Kennedy 's efforts would create a division in the ranks which could then be exploited .\nRowe finally joined the Humphrey campaign in frustration , another move which Johnson thought played into his own strategy .\n= = = Candidacy for president = = =\nJohnson made a late entry into the campaign in July 1960 which , coupled with a reluctance to leave Washington , allowed the rival Kennedy campaign to secure a substantial early advantage among Democratic state party officials .\nJohnson underestimated Kennedy 's endearing qualities of charm and intelligence , as compared to his own reputation as the more crude and wheeling-dealing \" Landslide Lyndon \" .\nCaro suggests that Johnson 's hesitancy was the result of an overwhelming fear of failure .\nJohnson attempted in vain to capitalize on Kennedy 's youth , poor health , and failure to take a position regarding Joseph McCarthy .\nHe had formed a \" Stop Kennedy \" coalition with Adlai Stevenson , Stuart Symington , and Hubert Humphrey , but it proved a failure .\nJohnson received 409 votes on the only ballot at the Democratic convention to Kennedy 's 806 , and so the convention nominated Kennedy .\nTip O 'Neill was a representative from Kennedy 's home state of Massachusetts at that time , and he recalled that Johnson approached him at the convention and said , \" Tip , I know you have to support Kennedy at the start , but I 'd like to have you with me on the second ballot . \"\nO 'Neill replied , \" Senator , there 's not going to be any second ballot . \"\n= = = Vice-presidential nomination = = =\nAccording to Kennedy 's Special Counsel Myer Feldman and to Kennedy himself , it is impossible to reconstruct the precise manner in which Johnson 's vice-presidential nomination ultimately took place .\nKennedy did realize that he could not be elected without support of traditional Southern Democrats , most of whom had backed Johnson ; nevertheless , labor leaders were unanimous in their opposition to Johnson .\nAfter much back and forth with party leaders and others on the matter , Kennedy did offer Johnson the vice-presidential nomination at the Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel at 10 : 15 am on July 14 , the morning after he was nominated , and Johnson accepted .\nFrom that point to the actual nomination that evening , the facts are in dispute in many respects .\n( Convention chairman LeRoy Collins ' declaration of a two-thirds majority in favor by voice vote is even disputed . )\nSeymour Hersh stated that Robert F.

Johnson was needed on the ticket to help carry Texas and the Southern states .\nCaro 's research showed that on July 14 , John Kennedy started the process while Johnson was still asleep .\nAt 6 : 30 am , John Kennedy asked Robert Kennedy to prepare an estimate of upcoming electoral votes \" including Texas \" .\nRobert called Pierre Salinger and Kenneth O 'Donnell to assist him .\nSalinger realized the ramifications of counting Texas votes as their own , and asked him whether he was considering a Kennedy-Johnson ticket , and Robert replied \" yes \" .\nCaro contends that it was then that John Kennedy called Johnson to arrange a meeting ; he also called Pennsylvania governor David L. Lawrence , a Johnson backer , to request that he nominate Johnson for vice president if Johnson were to accept the role .\nAccording to Caro , Kennedy and Johnson met and Johnson said that Kennedy would have trouble with Kennedy supporters who were anti \u2013 Johnson .\nKennedy returned to his suite to announce the Kennedy-Johnson ticket to his closest supporters , including northern political bosses .\nO 'Donnell was angry at what he considered a betrayal by Kennedy , who had previously cast Johnson as anti-labor and anti-liberal .\nAfterward , Robert Kennedy visited labor leaders who were extremely unhappy with the choice of Johnson and , after seeing the depth of labor opposition to Johnson , Robert ran messages between the hotel suites of his brother and Johnson \u2014 apparently trying to undermine the proposed ticket without John Kennedy 's authorization .\nCaro continues in his analysis that Robert Kennedy tried to get Johnson to agree to be the Democratic Party chairman rather than vice president .\nJohnson refused to accept a change in plans unless it came directly from John Kennedy .\nDespite his brother 's interference , John Kennedy was firm that Johnson was who he wanted as running mate ; he met with staffers such as Larry O 'Brien , his national campaign manager , to say that Johnson was to be vice president .\nO 'Brien recalled later that John Kennedy 's words were wholly unexpected , but that after a brief consideration of the electoral vote situation , he thought \" it was a stroke of genius \" .\nWhen John and Robert Kennedy next saw their father Joe Kennedy , he told them that signing Johnson as running mate was the smartest thing that they had ever done .\n= = = Re-election to U.S .

Blakley was appointed to replace Johnson as Senator , but Blakley lost a special election in May 1961 to Tower .\n= = Vice Presidency ( 1961 \u2013 1963 ) = =\nAfter the election , Johnson was quite concerned about the traditionally ineffective nature of his new office , and set about to assume authority not allotted to the position .\nHe initially sought a transfer of the authority of Senate majority leader to the vice presidency , since that office made him president of the Senate , but faced vehement opposition from the Democratic Caucus , including members whom he had counted as his supporters .\nJohnson sought to increase his influence within the executive branch .\nHe drafted an executive order for Kennedy 's signature , granting Johnson \" general supervision \" over matters of national security , and requiring all government agencies to \" cooperate fully with the vice president in the carrying out of these assignments . \"\nKennedy 's response was to sign a non-binding letter requesting Johnson to \" review \" national security policies instead .\nKennedy similarly turned down early requests from Johnson to be given an office adjacent to the Oval Office , and to employ a full-time Vice Presidential staff within the White House .\nHis lack of influence was thrown into relief later in 1961 when Kennedy appointed Johnson 's friend Sarah T. Hughes to a federal judgeship , whereas Johnson had tried and failed to garner the nomination for Hughes at the beginning of his vice presidency .\nHouse Speaker Sam Rayburn wrangled the appointment from Kennedy in exchange for support of an administration bill .\nMoreover , many members of the Kennedy White House were contemptuous of Johnson , including the president 's brother , Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy , and they ridiculed his comparatively brusque , crude manner .\nCongressman Tip O 'Neill recalled that the Kennedy men \" had a disdain for Johnson that they didn 't even try to hide .... They actually took pride in snubbing him . \"\nKennedy , however , made efforts to keep Johnson busy , informed , and at the White House often , telling aides , \" I can 't afford to have my vice president , who knows every reporter in Washington , going around saying we 're all screwed up , so we 're going to keep him happy . \"\nKennedy appointed him to jobs such as head of the President 's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunities , through which he worked with African Americans and other minorities .\nKennedy may have intended this to remain a more nominal position , but Taylor Branch in Pillar of Fire contends that Johnson pushed the Kennedy administration 's actions further and faster for civil rights than Kennedy originally intended to go .\nBranch notes the irony of Johnson being the advocate for civil rights , when the Kennedy family had hoped that he would appeal to conservative southern voters .\nIn particular , he notes Johnson 's Memorial Day 1963 speech at Gettysburg , Pennsylvania as being a catalyst that led to more action .\nJohnson took on numerous minor diplomatic missions , which gave him limited insights into global issues , as well as opportunities at self-promotion in the name of showing the country 's flag .\nHe attended Cabinet and National Security Council meetings .\nKennedy gave Johnson control over all presidential appointments involving Texas , and appointed him chairman of the President 's Ad Hoc Committee for Science .\nKennedy also appointed Johnson Chairman of the National Aeronautics Space Council .\nThe Soviets beat the US with the first manned spaceflight in April 1961 , and Kennedy gave Johnson the task of evaluating the state of the US space program and recommending a project that would allow the US to catch up or beat the Soviets .\nJohnson responded with a recommendation that the US gain the leadership role by committing the resources to embark on a project to land an American on the Moon in the 1960s .\nKennedy assigned priority to the space program , but Johnson 's appointment provided potential cover in case of a failure .\nJohnson was touched by a Senate scandal in August 1963 when Bobby Baker , the Secretary to the Majority Leader of the Senate and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Johnson 's , came under investigation by the Senate Rules Committee for allegations of bribery and financial malfeasance .\nOne witness alleged that Baker had arranged for the witness to give kickbacks for the Vice President .\nBaker resigned in October , and the investigation did not expand to Johnson .\nThe negative publicity from the affair fed rumors in Washington circles that Kennedy was planning on dropping Johnson from the Democratic ticket in the upcoming 1964 presidential election .\nHowever , on October 31 , 1963 , a reporter asked if he intended and expected to have Johnson on the ticket the following year .\nKennedy replied , \" Yes to both those questions . \"\nThere is little doubt that Robert Kennedy and Johnson hated each other , yet John and Robert Kennedy agreed that dropping Johnson from the ticket could produce heavy losses in the South in the 1964 election , and they agreed that Johnson would stay on the ticket .\n= = Presidency ( 1963 \u2013 1969 ) = =\nJohnson 's presidency took place during a healthy economy , with steady growth and low unemployment .\nRegarding the rest of the world , there were no serious controversies with major countries .\nAttention therefore focused on domestic policy , and , after 1966 , on the Vietnam War .\n= = = Succession = = =\nJohnson was quickly sworn in as President on Air Force One in Dallas on November 22 , 1963 , just 2 hours and 8 minutes after John F.

Hughes , a family friend .\nIn the rush , a Bible was not at hand , so Johnson took the oath of office using a Roman Catholic missal from President Kennedy 's desk .\nCecil Stoughton 's iconic photograph of Johnson taking the presidential oath of office as Mrs. Kennedy looks on is the most famous photo ever taken aboard a presidential aircraft .\nHe was convinced of the need to make an immediate transition of power after the assassination to provide stability to a grieving nation in shock .\nHe and the Secret Service were concerned that he could also be a target of a conspiracy , and felt compelled to rapidly remove the new president from Dallas and return him to Washington .\nThis was greeted by some with assertions that Johnson was in too much haste to assume power .\nIn the days following the assassination , Lyndon B. Johnson made an address to Congress saying that \" No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy 's memory than the earliest possible passage of the Civil Rights Bill for which he fought so long . \"\nThe wave of national grief following the assassination gave enormous momentum to Johnson 's promise to carry out Kennedy 's plans and his policy of seizing Kennedy 's legacy to give momentum to his legislative agenda .\nOn November 29 , 1963 , just one week after Kennedy 's assassination , Johnson issued an executive order to rename NASA 's Apollo Launch Operations Center and the NASA \/ Air Force Cape Canaveral launch facilities as the John F. Kennedy Space Center .\nCape Canaveral was officially known as Cape Kennedy from 1963-1973 .\nJohnson was alert to the public demand for answers .\nTo head off snowballing speculation about such conspiracies , he immediately created a panel headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren , known as the Warren Commission , to investigate Kennedy 's assassination .\nThe commission conducted extensive research and hearings and unanimously concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination .\nConspiracy theorists were not satisfied and they stayed active .\nJohnson retained senior Kennedy appointees , some for the full term of his presidency .\nHe even retained Robert Kennedy as Attorney General , with whom he had a notoriously difficult relationship .\nRobert Kennedy remained in office for a few months until leaving in 1964 to run for the Senate .\nAlthough Johnson had no official chief of staff , Walter Jenkins was the first among a handful of equals and presided over the details of daily operations at the White House .\nGeorge Reedy , who was Johnson 's second-longest-serving aide , assumed the post of press secretary when John F. Kennedy 's own Pierre Salinger left that post in March 1964 .\nHorace Busby was another \" triple-threat man , \" as Johnson referred to his aides .\nHe served primarily as a speech writer and political analyst .\nBill Moyers was the youngest member of Johnson 's staff .\nHe handled scheduling and speechwriting part-time .\n= = = Rapid legislative initiatives = = =\nThe new president thought it advantageous to quickly pursue one of Kennedy 's primary legislative goals \u2014 a tax cut .\nJohnson worked closely with Harry F. Byrd of Virginia to negotiate a reduction in the budget below $ 100 billion in exchange for what became overwhelming Senate approval of the Revenue Act of 1964 .\nCongressional approval followed at the end of February , and facilitated efforts to follow on civil rights .\nIn late 1963 Johnson also launched the initial offensive of his War on Poverty , recruiting Kennedy relative Sargent Shriver , then head of the Peace Corps , to spearhead the effort .\nIn March 1964 , LBJ sent to Congress the Economic Opportunity Act , which created the Job Corps and the Community Action Program , designed to attack poverty locally .\nThe act also created VISTA , Volunteers in Service to America , a domestic counterpart to the Peace Corps .\n= = = Civil Rights Movement = = =\nPresident Kennedy had submitted a civil-rights bill to Congress in June 1963 , which was met with strong opposition .\nJohnson renewed the effort and asked Bobby Kennedy to spearhead the undertaking for the administration on Capitol Hill .\nThis provided adequate political cover for Johnson should the effort fail ; but if it were successful , Johnson would receive ample credit .\nHistorian Robert Caro notes that the bill Kennedy had submitted was facing the same tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past ; southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure to prevent it from coming to a vote .\nIn particular , they held up all of the major bills Kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent , especially the tax reform bill , in order to force the bill 's supporters to pull it .\nJohnson was quite familiar with the procedural tactic , as he played a role in a similar tactic against a civil rights bill that Harry Truman had submitted to Congress fifteen years earlier .\nIn that fight , a rent-control renewal bill was held up until the civil-rights bill was withdrawn .\nBelieving that the current course meant that the Civil Rights Act would suffer the same fate , he adopted a different strategy from that of Kennedy , who had mostly removed himself from the legislative process .\nBy tackling the tax cut first , the previous tactic was eliminated .\nPassing the civil rights bill in the House required getting it through the Rules Committee , which had been holding it up in an attempt to kill it .\nJohnson decided on a campaign to use a discharge petition to force it onto the House floor .\nFacing a growing threat that they would be bypassed , the House rules committee approved the bill and moved it to the floor of the full House , which passed it shortly thereafter by a vote of 290 \u2013 110 .\nIn the Senate , since the tax bill had passed three days earlier , the anti-civil-rights senators were left with the filibuster as their only remaining tool .\nOvercoming the filibuster required the support of over twenty Republicans , who were growing less supportive due to the fact that their party was about to nominate for president a candidate who opposed the bill .\nAccording to Caro , it was ultimately Johnson 's ability to convince Republican leader Everett Dirksen to support the bill that amassed the necessary Republican votes to overcome the filibuster in March 1964 ; after 75 hours of debate , the bill passed the Senate by a vote of 71 \u2013 29 .\nJohnson signed the fortified Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law on July 2 .\nLegend has it that the evening after signing the bill , Johnson told an aide , \" I think we just delivered the South to the Republican party for a long time to come \" , anticipating a coming backlash from Southern whites against Johnson 's Democratic Party .\nBiographer Randall B.\nWoods has argued that Johnson effectively used appeals to Judeo-Christian ethics to garner support for the civil rights law .\nWoods writes that Johnson undermined the Southern filibuster against the bill :\nWoods states that Johnson 's religiosity ran deep : \" At 15 he joined the Disciples of Christ , or Christian , church and would forever believe that it was the duty of the rich to care for the poor , the strong to assist the weak , and the educated to speak for the inarticulate . \"\nJohnson shared the beliefs of his mentor , FDR , in that he paired liberal values to religious values , believing that freedom and social justice served both God and man .\n= = = The Great Society = = =\nJohnson wanted a catchy slogan for the 1964 campaign to describe his proposed domestic agenda for 1965 .\nEric Goldman , who joined the White House in December of that year , thought Johnson 's domestic program was best captured in the title of Walter Lippman 's book , The Good Society .\nRichard Goodwin tweaked it \u2014 to \" The Great Society \" \u2014 and incorporated this in detail as part of a speech for Johnson in May 1964 at the University of Michigan .\nIt encompassed movements of urban renewal , modern transportation , clean environment , anti-poverty , healthcare reform , crime control , and educational reform .\n= = = 1964 presidential election = = =\nIn Spring 1964 , Johnson did not look optimistically upon the prospect of being elected president in his own right .\nA pivotal change took place in April when he assumed personal management of negotiations between the railroad brotherhood and the railroad industry over the issue of featherbedding .\nJohnson emphasized to the parties the potential impact upon the economy of a strike .\nAfter considerable horse trading , especially with the carriers who won promises from the president for greater freedom in setting rights and more liberal depreciation allowances by the IRS , Johnson got an agreement .\nThis substantially boosted his self-confidence as well as his image .\nThat same year , Robert F. Kennedy was widely considered an impeccable choice to run as Johnson 's vice presidential running mate but Johnson and Kennedy however had never liked one another and Johnson , afraid that Kennedy would be credited with his election as president , abhorred the idea and opposed it at every turn .\nKennedy was himself undecided about the position and , knowing that the prospect rankled Johnson , was content in refusing to eliminate himself from consideration .\nUltimately , Goldwater 's poor polling numbers degraded any dependence Johnson might have had on Kennedy as his running mate .\nHubert Humphrey 's selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion , and was thought to strengthen Johnson in the Midwest and industrial Northeast .\nJohnson , knowing full well the degree of frustration inherent in the office of vice president , put Humphrey through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee his absolute loyalty and having made the decision , he kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation and coverage .\nIn preparation for the Democratic convention , Johnson requested the FBI send a squad of 30 agents to cover convention activities ; the objective of the squad was to inform the White House staff of any disruptive activities on the floor .\nThe squad 's focus narrowed upon the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party ( MFDP ) delegation , which sought to displace the white segregationist delegation regularly selected in the state .\nThe squad 's activities also included wiretaps of Martin Luther King 's room as well as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) and the Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) .\nFrom beginning to end , the squad 's assignment was carefully couched in terms of the monitoring of disruptive activities that might endanger the president and other high-ranking officials .\nIn fact , Johnson was very concerned about potential political damage from media coverage of racial tensions exposed by a credentials fight between the MFDP and the segregationist delegation , and he assigned Humphrey the job of managing the problem .\nThe convention 's Credentials Committee declared that two MFDP delegates in the delegation be seated as observers and agreed to \" bar future delegations from states where any citizens are deprived of the right to vote by reason of their race or color . \"\nThe MFDP rejected the committee 's ruling .\nThe convention became the apparent personal triumph that Johnson craved , but a sense of betrayal caused by the marginalization of the MFDP would trigger disaffection with Johnson and the Democratic Party from the left ; SNCC chairman John Lewis would call it a \" turning point in the civil rights movement . \"\nEarly in the 1964 presidential campaign , Barry Goldwater appeared to be a strong contender , with strong support from the South , which threatened Johnson 's position as he had predicted in reaction to the passage of the Civil Rights Act .\nHowever , Goldwater lost momentum as his campaign progressed .\nOn September 7 , 1964 , Johnson 's campaign managers broadcast the \" Daisy ad \" .\nIt portrayed a little girl picking petals from a daisy , counting up to ten .\nThen a baritone voice took over , counted down from ten to zero and the visual showed the explosion of a nuclear bomb .\nThe message conveyed was that electing Goldwater president held the danger of a nuclear war .\nGoldwater 's campaign message was best symbolized by the bumper sticker displayed by supporters claiming \" In your heart , you know he 's right . \" .\nOpponents captured the spirit of Johnson 's campaign with bumper stickers that said \" In your heart , you know he might \" and \" In your gut , you know he 's nuts \" .\nJohnson won the presidency by a landslide with 61.05 percent of the vote , making it the highest ever share of the popular vote .\nAt the time , this was also the widest popular margin in the 20th century \u2014 more than 15.95 million votes \u2014 this was later surpassed by incumbent President Nixon 's victory in 1972 .\nIn the Electoral College , Johnson defeated Goldwater by a margin of 486 to 52 .\nJohnson won 44 states , compared to Goldwater 's six .\nVoters also gave Johnson the largest majorities in Congress since FDR 's election in 1936 \u2014 a Senate with a 68 \u2013 32 majority and a house with a 295 \u2013 140 Democratic margin .\n= = = Voting Rights Act = = =\nJohnson began his elected presidential term with similar motives as he had upon succeeding to the office , ready to \" carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy .\nNot because of our sorrow or sympathy , but because they are right . \"\nHe was reticent to push southern congressmen even further after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and suspected their support may have been temporarily tapped out .\nNevertheless , the Selma to Montgomery marches in Alabama led by Martin Luther King ultimately led Johnson to initiate debate on a voting rights bill in February 1965 .\nJohnson gave a congressional speech \u2014 Dallek considers it his greatest \u2014 in which he said \" rarely at anytime does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself \u2026 rarely are we met with the challenge \u2026 to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation .\nThe issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue .\nAnd should we defeat every enemy , should we double our wealth and conquer the stars , and still be unequal to this issue , then we will have failed as a people and as a nation . \"\nIn 1965 , he achieved passage of a second civil rights bill called the Voting Rights Act , which outlawed discrimination in voting thus allowing millions of southern blacks to vote for the first time .\nIn accordance with the act , several states , \" seven of the eleven southern states of the former confederacy \" ( Alabama , South Carolina , North Carolina , Georgia , Louisiana , Mississippi , Virginia ) were subjected to the procedure of preclearance in 1965 while Texas , then home to the largest African American population of any state , followed in 1975 .\nThe Senate passed the voting rights bill by a vote of 77 \u2013 19 just after 2 1 \/ 2 months and won passage in the house in July , by 333 \u2013 85 .\nThe results were significant \u2014 between the years of 1968 and 1980 , the number of southern black elected state and federal officeholders nearly doubled .\nThe act also made a large difference in the numbers of black elected officials nationally \u2014 in 1965 , a few hundred black office-holders mushroomed to 6,000 in 1989 .\nAfter the murder of civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo , Johnson went on television to announce the arrest of four Ku Klux Klansmen implicated in her death .\nHe angrily denounced the Klan as a \" hooded society of bigots , \" and warned them to \" return to a decent society before it 's too late . \"\nJohnson was the first President to arrest and prosecute members of the Klan since Ulysses S. Grant about 93 years earlier .\nHe turned to themes of Christian redemption to push for civil rights , thereby mobilizing support from churches North and South .\nAt the Howard University commencement address on June 4 , 1965 , he said that both the government and the nation needed to help achieve goals , \" To shatter forever not only the barriers of law and public practice , but the walls which bound the condition of many by the color of his skin .\nTo dissolve , as best we can , the antique enmities of the heart which diminish the holder , divide the great democracy , and do wrong \u2014 great wrong \u2014 to the children of God ...\nIn 1967 , Johnson nominated civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall to be the first African American justice of the Supreme Court .\nTo head the new Department of Housing and Urban Development , Johnson appointed Robert C. Weaver \u2014 the first African-American cabinet secretary in any U.S. presidential administration .\nIn 1968 Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968 , which provided for equal housing opportunities regardless of race , creed , or national origin .\nThe impetus for the law 's passage came from the 1966 Chicago Open Housing Movement , the April 4 , 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King , Jr . , and the civil unrest across the country following King 's death .\nOn April 5 , Johnson wrote a letter to the United States House of Representatives urging passage of the Fair Housing Act .\nWith newly urgent attention from legislative director Joseph Califano and Democratic Speaker of the House John McCormack , the bill ( which was previously stalled ) passed the House by a wide margin on April 10 .\n= = = Immigration = = =\nWith the passage of the sweeping Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 , the country 's immigration system was reformed and all national origins quotas dating from the 1920s were removed .\nThe annual rate of inflow doubled between 1965 and 1970 , and doubled again by 1990 , with dramatic increases from Asia and Mexico .\nScholars give Johnson little credit for the law , which was not one of his priorities ;

with considerable facilitating by the White House , it passed the House by a vote of 263 to 153 on March 26 and then it remarkably passed without change in the Senate , by 73 to 8 , without going through the usual conference committee .\nThis was an historic accomplishment by the president , with the billion dollar bill passing as introduced just 87 days before .\nFor the first time , large amounts of federal money went to public schools .\nIn practice ESEA meant helping all public school districts , with more money going to districts that had large proportions of students from poor families ( which included all the big cities ) .\nFor the first time private schools ( most of them Catholic schools in the inner cities ) received services , such as library funding , comprising about 12 percent of the ESEA budget .\nThough federal funds were involved , they were administered by local officials , and by 1977 it was reported that less than half of the funds were actually applied toward the education of children under the poverty line .\nDallek further reports that researchers cited by Hugh Davis Graham soon found that poverty had more to do with family background and neighborhood conditions than the quantity of education a child received .\nEarly studies suggested initial improvements for poor children helped by ESEA reading and math programs , but later assessments indicated that benefits faded quickly and left pupils little better off than those not in the schemes .\nJohnson 's second major education program was the Higher Education Act of 1965 , which focused on funding for lower income students , including grants , work-study money , and government loans .\nAlthough ESEA solidified Johnson 's support among K-12 teachers ' unions , neither the Higher Education Act nor the new endowments mollified the college professors and students growing increasingly uneasy with the war in Vietnam .\nIn 1967 , Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act to create educational television programs to supplement the broadcast networks .\nIn 1965 , Johnson also set up the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts , to support academic subjects such as literature , history , and law , and arts such as music , painting , and sculpture ( as the WPA once did ) .\n= = = \" War on Poverty \" and healthcare reform = = =\nIn 1964 , at Johnson 's request , Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1964 and the Economic Opportunity Act , as part of the war on poverty .\nJohnson set in motion legislation creating programs such as Head Start , food stamps and Work Study .\nDuring Johnson 's years in office , national poverty declined significantly , with the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line dropping from 23 percent to 12 percent .\nJohnson took an additional step in the War on Poverty with an urban renewal effort , presenting to Congress in January 1966 the \" Demonstration Cities Program \" .\nTo be eligible a city would need to demonstrate its readiness to \" arrest blight and decay and make substantial impact on the development of its entire city . \"\nJohnson requested an investment of $ 400 million per year totaling $ 2.4 billion .\nIn the fall of 1966 the Congress passed a substantially reduced program costing $ 900 million , which Johnson later called the Model Cities Program .\nChanging the name had little effect on the success of the bill ; the New York Times wrote 22 years later that the program was for the most part a failure .\nJohnson 's initial effort to improve healthcare was the creation of The Commission on Heart Disease , Cancer and Strokes ( HDCS ) .\nCombined , these diseases accounted for 71 percent of the nation 's deaths in 1962 .\nTo enact recommendations of the commission , Johnson asked Congress for funds to set up the Regional Medical Program ( RMP ) , to create a network of hospitals with federally funded research and practice ; Congress passed a significantly watered down version .\nAs a back-up position , in 1965 Johnson turned his focus to hospital insurance for the aged under Social Security .\nThe key player in initiating this program , named Medicare , was Wilbur Mills , Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee .\nIn order to reduce Republican opposition , Mills suggested that Medicare be fashioned as a three layer cake \u2014 hospital insurance under Social Security , a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor , known as Medicaid .\nThe bill passed the house by a margin of 110 votes on April 8 .\nThe effort in the Senate was considerably more complicated ; however , the Medicare bill passed Congress on July 28 after negotiation in a conference committee .\nMedicare now covers tens of millions of Americans .\nJohnson gave the first two Medicare cards to former President Harry S Truman and his wife Bess after signing the Medicare bill at the Truman Library in Independence , Missouri .\n= = = Transportation = = =\nIn March 1965 , Johnson sent to Congress a transportation message which included the creation of a new Transportation Department \u2014 which would include the Commerce Department 's Office of Transportation , the Bureau of Public Roads , the Federal Aviation Agency , the Coast Guard , the Maritime Administration , the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Interstate Commerce Commission .\nThe bill passed the Senate after some negotiation over navigation projects ; in the house , passage required negotiation over maritime interests and the bill was signed October 15 , 1965 .\n= = = Gun control = = =\nOn October 22 , 1968 , Lyndon Johnson signed the Gun Control Act of 1968 , one of the largest and farthest-reaching federal gun control laws in American history .\nMuch of the motivation for this large expansion of federal gun regulations came as a response to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy , Robert F. Kennedy , and Martin Luther King Jr .\n= = = Space program = = =\nDuring Johnson 's administration , NASA conducted the Gemini manned space program , developed the Saturn V rocket and its launch facility , and prepared to make the first manned Apollo program flights .\nOn January 27 , 1967 , the nation was stunned when the entire crew of Apollo 1 was killed in a cabin fire during a spacecraft test on the launch pad , stopping Apollo in its tracks .\nRather than appointing another Warren-style commission , Johnson accepted Administrator James E. Webb 's request for NASA to do its own investigation , holding itself accountable to Congress and the President .\nJohnson maintained his staunch support of Apollo through Congressional and press controversy , and the program recovered .\nThe first two manned missions , Apollo 7 and the first manned flight to the Moon , Apollo 8 , were completed by the end of Johnson 's term .\nHe congratulated the Apollo 8 crew , saying , \" You 've taken ... all of us , all over the world , into a new era . \"\nOn July 16 , 1969 , Johnson attended the launch of the first Moon landing mission Apollo 11 , becoming the first former or incumbent US president to witness a rocket launch .\n= = = Urban riots = = =\nMajor riots in black neighborhoods caused a series of \" long hot summers . \"\nThey started with a violent disturbance in the Harlem riots in 1964 , and the Watts district of Los Angeles in 1965 , and extended to 1971 .\nThe momentum for the advancement of civil rights came to a sudden halt in the summer of 1965 , with the riots in Watts .\nAfter 34 people were killed and $ 35 million in property was damaged , the public feared an expansion of the violence to other cities , and so the appetite for additional programs in LBJ 's agenda was lost .\nNewark burned in 1967 , where six days of rioting left 26 dead , 1500 injured , and the inner city a burned out shell .\nIn Detroit in 1967 , Governor George Romney sent in 7400 national guard troops to quell fire bombings , looting , and attacks on businesses and on police .\nJohnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns .\nDetroit continued to burn for three more days until finally 43 were dead , 2250 were injured , 4000 were arrested ; property damage ranged into the hundreds of millions .\nThe biggest wave of riots came in April 1968 in over a hundred cities after the assassination of Martin Luther King .\nJohnson called for even more billions to be spent in the cities and another federal civil rights law regarding housing , but this fell on deaf ears .\nJohnson 's popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape , reinforcing the sense Johnson had lost control of the streets of major cities as well as his party .\nJohnson created the Kerner Commission to study the problem of urban riots , headed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner .\nAccording to press secretary George Christian , Johnson was unsurprised by the riots , saying : \" What did you expect ?\nI don 't know why we 're so surprised .\nWhen you put your foot on a man 's neck and hold him down for three hundred years , and then you let him up , what 's he going to do ?\nHe 's going to knock your block off . \"\n= = = Backlash against Johnson : 1966 \u2013 1967 = = =\nIn 1966 the press sensed a \" credibility gap \" between what Johnson was saying in press conferences and what was happening on the ground in Vietnam , which led to much less favorable coverage .\nBy year 's end , the Democratic governor of Missouri , Warren E. Hearnes , warned that Johnson would lose the state by 100,000 votes , despite winning by a 500,000 margin in 1964 .\n\" Frustration over Vietnam ; too much federal spending and ... taxation ; no great public support for your Great Society programs ; and ... public disenchantment with the civil rights programs \" had eroded the President 's standing , the governor reported .\nThere were bright spots ; in January 1967 , Johnson boasted that wages were the highest in history , unemployment was at a 13-year low , and corporate profits and farm incomes were greater than ever ; a 4.5 percent jump in consumer prices was worrisome , as was the rise in interest rates .\nJohnson asked for a temporary 6 percent surcharge in income taxes to cover the mounting deficit caused by increased spending .\nJohnson 's approval ratings stayed below 50 percent ; by January 1967 , the number of his strong supporters had plunged to 16 % , from 25 percent four months before .\nHe ran about even with Republican George Romney in trial matchups that spring .\nAsked to explain why he was unpopular , Johnson responded , \" I am a dominating personality , and when I get things done I don 't always please all the people . \"\nJohnson also blamed the press , saying they showed \" complete irresponsibility and lie and misstate facts and have no one to be answerable to . \"\nHe also blamed \" the preachers , liberals and professors \" who had turned against him .\nIn the congressional elections of 1966 , the Republicans gained three seats in the Senate and 47 in the House , reinvigorating the conservative coalition and making it more difficult for Johnson to pass any additional Great Society legislation .\nHowever , in the end Congress passed almost 96 percent of the administration 's Great Society programs , which Johnson then signed into law .\n= = = Vietnam War = = =\nAt Kennedy 's death , there were 16,000 American military personnel stationed in Vietnam ; these personnel supported South Vietnam in the Vietnam War against North Vietnam .\nVietnam had been partitioned at the 1954 Geneva Conference into two countries , with North Vietnam led by a Communist government .\nJohnson subscribed to the Domino Theory in Vietnam and to a containment policy that required America to make a serious effort to stop all Communist expansion .\nOn taking office , Johnson immediately reversed Kennedy 's order to withdraw 1,000 military personnel by the end of 1963 .\nIn late summer 1964 , Johnson seriously questioned the value of staying in Vietnam but , after meeting with Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Maxwell D. Taylor , declared his readiness \" to do more when we had a base \" or when Saigon was politically more stable .\nHe expanded the numbers and roles of the American military following the Gulf of Tonkin Incident .\n= = = = 1964 = = = =\nIn August 1964 , allegations arose from the military that two US destroyers had been attacked by some North Vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters from the Vietnamese coast in the Gulf of Tonkin ; naval communications and reports of the attack were contradictory .\nAlthough Johnson very much wanted to keep discussions about Vietnam out of the 1964 election campaign , he felt forced to respond to the supposed aggression by the Vietnamese , so he sought and obtained from the Congress the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution on August 7 .\nJohnson , determined to embolden his image on foreign policy , also wanted to prevent criticism such as Truman had received in Korea by proceeding without congressional endorsement of military action ; a response to the purported attack as well blunted presidential campaign criticism of weakness from the hawkish Goldwater camp .\nThe resolution gave congressional approval for use of military force by the commander-in-chief to repel future attacks and also to assist members of SEATO requesting assistance .\nJohnson later in the campaign expressed assurance that the primary US goal remained the preservation of South Vietnamese independence through material and advice , as opposed to any US offensive posture .\nThe public 's reaction to the resolution at the time was positive \u2014 48 percent favored stronger measures in Vietnam and only 14 percent wanted to negotiate a settlement and leave .\nIn the 1964 presidential campaign , Johnson restated his determination to provide measured support for Vietnam while avoiding another Korea ; but privately he had a sense of foreboding about Vietnam \u2014 a feeling that no matter what he did things would end badly .\nIndeed , his heart was on his Great Society agenda , and he even felt that his political opponents favored greater intervention in Vietnam in order to divert attention and resources away from his War on Poverty .\nThe situation on the ground was aggravated in the fall by additional Viet Minh attacks on US ships in the Tonkin Gulf , as well as an attack on Bien Hoa Air Base in South Vietnam .\nJohnson decided against retaliatory action at the time after consultation with the Joint Chiefs and also after public pollster Lou Harris confirmed that his decision would not detrimentally affect him at the polls .\nBy the end of 1964 , there were approximately 23,000 military personnel in South Vietnam .\nU.S. casualties for 1964 totaled 1,278 .\nIn the winter of 1964 \u2013 65 Johnson was pressured by the military to begin a bombing campaign to forcefully resist a communist takeover in South Vietnam ; moreover , a plurality in the polls at the time were in favor of military action against the communists , with only 26 to 30 percent opposed .\nJohnson revised his priorities , and a new preference for stronger action came at the end of January with yet another change of government in Saigon .\nHe then agreed with Mac Bundy and McNamara , that the continued passive role would only lead to defeat and withdrawal in humiliation .\nJohnson said , \" Stable government or no stable government in Saigon we will do what we ought to do .\nI 'm prepared to do that ; we will move strongly .\nGeneral Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh ( head of the new government ) is our boy \" .\n= = = = 1965 = = = =\nJohnson decided on a systematic bombing campaign in February after a ground report from Bundy recommending immediate US action to avoid defeat ; also , the Viet Cong had just killed eight US advisers and wounded dozens of others in an attack at Pleiku Air Base .\nThe eight-week bombing campaign became known as Operation Rolling Thunder .\nJohnson 's instructions for public consumption were clear \u2014 there was to be no comment that the war effort had been expanded .\nLong term estimates of the bombing campaign ranged from an expectation that Hanoi would rein in the Viet Cong to one of provoking Hanoi and the Viet Cong into an intensification of the war .\nBut the short-term expectations were consistent - that the morale and stability of the South Vietnamese government would be bolstered .\nBy limiting the information given out to the public and even to Congress , Johnson maximized his flexibility to change course .\nIn March , Bundy began to urge the use of ground forces \u2014 American air operations alone he counseled would not stop Hanoi 's aggression against the South .\nJohnson approved an increase in logistical troops of 18,000 to 20,000 , the deployment of two additional Marine battalions and a Marine air squadron , in addition to planning for the deployment of two more divisions \u2014 and most importantly a change in mission from defensive to offensive operations ; nevertheless , he disobligingly continued to insist that this was not to be publicly represented as a change in existing policy .\nBy the middle of June , the total US ground forces in Vietnam were increased to 82,000 or by 150 percent .\nThat same month , Ambassador Taylor reported that the bombing offensive against North Vietnam had been ineffective , and that the South Vietnamese army was outclassed and in danger of collapse .\nGen. Westmoreland shortly thereafter recommended the president further increase ground troops from 82,000 to 175,000 .\nAfter consulting with his principals , Johnson , desirous of a low profile , chose to announce at a press conference an increase to 125,000 troops , with additional forces to be sent later upon request .\nJohnson described himself at the time as boxed in by unpalatable choices \u2014 between sending Americans to die in Vietnam and giving in to the communists .\nIf he sent additional troops he would be attacked as an interventionist and if he did not he thought he risked being impeached .\nHe continued to insist that his decision \" did not imply any change in policy whatsoever \" .\nOf his desire to veil the decision , Johnson jested privately , \" If you have a mother-in-law with only one eye , and she has it in the center of her forehead , you don 't keep her in the living room \" .\nBy October 1965 there were over 200,000 troops deployed in Vietnam .\n= = = = 1966 = = = =\nPublic as well as political impatience with the war began to emerge in the spring of 1966 .\nAt the time , when Johnson 's approval ratings were reaching new lows of 41 percent , Sen. Richard Russell , Chairman of the Armed Services Committee , reflected the national mood in June 1966 , when he declared it was time to \" get it over or get out \" .\nJohnson responded by saying to the press , \" we are trying to provide the maximum deterrence that we can to communist aggression with a minimum of cost . \"\nIn response to the intensified criticism of the war effort , Johnson employed the suspicion of communist subversion in the country , and press relations became strained .\nJohnson 's primary war policy opponent in Congress included among others the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , James William Fulbright .\nThe persistent Johnson began to seriously consider a more focused bombing campaign against petroleum , oil and lubrication facilities in North Vietnam in hopes of accelerating victory .\nHumphrey , Rusk and McNamara all agreed ; the bombing began the end of June .\nIn July polling results indicated that Americans favored the bombing campaign by a 5 to 1 margin ; however , in August a Defense Department study indicated that the bombing campaign had little impact on North Vietnam .\nIn the fall of 1966 however , multiple sources began to report progress was being made against the North Vietnamese logistics and infrastructure ; Johnson was urged from every corner to begin peace discussions .\nThere was no shortage of peace initiatives ; nevertheless , among protesters , English philosopher Bertrand Russell attacked Johnson 's policy as \" a barbaric aggressive war of conquest \" and in June he initiated the International War Crimes Tribunal as a means to condemn the American effort .\nThe gap with Hanoi was an unbridgeable demand on both sides for a unilateral end to bombing and withdrawal of forces .\nIn August , Johnson appointed Averell Harriman \" Ambassador for Peace \" to promote negotiations .\nWestmoreland and McNamara then recommended a concerted program to promote pacification ; Johnson formally placed this effort under military control in October .\nAlso in October 1966 , to reassure and promote his war effort , Johnson initiated a meeting with allies in Manila \u2014 the South Vietnamese , Thais , South Koreans , Filipinos , Australians and New Zealanders .\nThe conference ended with pronouncements to stand fast against communist aggression and to promote ideals of democracy and development in Vietnam and across Asia .\nFor Johnson it was a fleeting public relations success \u2014 confirmed by a 63 percent Vietnam approval rating in November .\nNevertheless , in December Johnson 's Vietnam approval rating was again back down in the 40s ; LBJ had become anxious to justify war casualties , and talked of the need for decisive victory , despite the unpopularity of the cause .\nIn a discussion about the war with former President Dwight Eisenhower on October 3 , 1966 , Johnson said he was \" trying to win it just as fast as I can in every way that I know how \" and later stated that he needed \" all the help I can get . \"\nBy year 's end it was clear that current pacification efforts were ineffectual , as had been the air campaign .\nJohnson then agreed to McNamara 's new recommendation to add 70,000 troops in 1967 to the 400,000 previously committed .\nWhile McNamara recommended no increase in the level of bombing , Johnson agreed with CIA recommendations to increase them .\nThe increased bombing began despite initial secret talks being held in Saigon , Hanoi and Warsaw .\nWhile the bombing ended the talks , North Vietnamese intentions were not considered genuine .\n= = = = 1967 = = = =\nJanuary and February 1967 included probes to detect North Vietnamese willingness to discuss peace , and all fell on deaf ears .\nHo Chi Minh declared that the only solution was a unilateral withdrawal by the U.S . A Gallup poll taken in July 1967 showed 52 percent of the country disapproving of the president 's handling of the war and only 34 percent thought progress was being made .\nJohnson 's anger and frustration over the lack of a solution to Vietnam and its effect on him politically was exhibited in a statement to Robert F. Kennedy , who had become a prominent public critic of the war and loomed as a potential challenger in the 1968 presidential election .\nJohnson had just received several reports predicting military progress by the summer , and warned Kennedy , \" I 'll destroy you and every one of your dove friends in six months \" , he shouted .\n\" You 'll be dead politically in six months \" .\nMcNamara offered Johnson a way out of Vietnam in May ; the administration could declare its objective in the war \u2014 South Vietnam 's self-determination \u2014 was being achieved and upcoming September elections in South Vietnam would provide the chance for a coalition government .\nThe United States could reasonably expect that country to then assume responsibility for the election outcome .\nBut Johnson was reluctant , in light of some optimistic reports , again of questionable reliability , which matched the negative assessments about the conflict and provided hope of improvement .\nThe CIA was reporting wide food shortages in Hanoi and an unstable power grid , as well as military manpower reductions .\nBy the middle of 1967 nearly 70,000 Americans had been killed or wounded in the war .\nIn July , Johnson sent McNamara , Wheeler and other officials to meet with Westmoreland and reach agreement on plans for the immediate future .\nAt that time the war was being commonly described by the press and others as a \" stalemate \" .\nWestmoreland said such a description was pure fiction , and that \" we are winning slowly but steadily and the pace can excel if we reinforce our successes \" .\nThough Westmoreland sought many more , Johnson agreed to an increase of 55,000 troops bringing the total to 525,000 .\nIn August Johnson , with the Joint Chiefs ' support , decided to expand the air campaign and exempted only Hanoi , Haiphong and a buffer zone with China from the target list .\nIn September Ho Chi Minh and North Vietnamese premier Pham Van Dong appeared amenable to French mediation , so Johnson ceased bombing in a 10-mile zone around Hanoi ; this was met with dissatisfaction .\nJohnson in a Texas speech agreed to halt all bombing if Ho Chi Minh would launch productive and meaningful discussions and if North Vietnam would not seek to take advantage of the halt ; this was named the \" San Antonio \" formula .\nThere was no response , but Johnson pursued the possibility of negotiations with such a bombing pause .\nWith the war still arguably in a stalemate and in light of the widespread disapproval of the conflict , Johnson convened a group called the \" Wise Men \" for a fresh , in-depth look at the war \u2014 Dean Acheson , Gen. Omar Bradley , George Ball , Mac Bundy , Arthur Dean , Douglas Dillon , Abe Fortas , Averell Harriman , Henry Cabot Lodge , Robert Murphy and Max Taylor .\nAt that time McNamara , reversing his position on the war , recommended that a cap of 525,000 be placed on the number of forces deployed and that the bombing be halted , since he could see no success .\nJohnson was quite agitated by this recommendation and McNamara 's resignation soon followed .\nWith the exception of George Ball , the \" Wise Men \" all agreed the administration should \" press forward \" .\nJohnson was confident that Hanoi would await the 1968 US election results before deciding to negotiate .\nOn June 23 , 1967 , Johnson traveled to Los Angeles for a Democratic fundraiser .\nThousands of anti-war protesters tried to march past the hotel where he was speaking .\nThe march was led by a coalition of peace protestors .\nHowever , a small group of Progressive Labor Party and SDS protestors activists placed themselves at the head of the march and , when they reached the hotel , staged a sit-down .\nEfforts by march monitors to keep the main body of the marchers moving were only partially successful .\nHundreds of LAPD officers were massed at the hotel and when the march slowed an order was given to disperse the crowd .\nThe Riot Act was read and 51 protestors arrested .\nThis was one of the first massive war protests in the United States and the first in Los Angeles .\nEnding in a clash with riot police , it set a pattern for the massive protests which followed .\nDue to the size and violence of this event , Johnson attempted no further public speeches in venues outside military bases .\nWith the ever-increasing public protests against the war , in October Johnson engaged the FBI and the CIA to investigate , monitor and undermine anti-war activists .\nIn mid-October there was a demonstration of 100,000 at the Pentagon ; Johnson and Rusk were convinced that foreign communist sources were behind the demonstration , which was refuted by CIA findings .\n= = = = 1968 = = = =\nAs casualties mounted and success seemed further away than ever , Johnson 's popularity plummeted .\nCollege students and others protested , burned draft cards , and chanted , \" Hey , hey , LBJ , how many kids did you kill today ? \"\nJohnson could scarcely travel anywhere without facing protests , and was not allowed by the Secret Service to attend the 1968 Democratic National Convention , where thousands of hippies , yippies , Black Panthers and other opponents of Johnson 's policies both in Vietnam and in the ghettos converged to protest .\nThus by 1968 , the public was polarized , with the \" hawks \" rejecting Johnson 's refusal to continue the war indefinitely , and the \" doves \" rejecting his current war policies .\nSupport for Johnson 's middle position continued to shrink until he finally rejected containment and sought a peace settlement .\nBy late summer , he realized that Nixon was closer to his position than Humphrey .\nHe continued to support Humphrey publicly in the election , and personally despised Nixon .\nOne of Johnson 's well known quotes was \" the Democratic party at its worst , is still better than the Republican party at its best \" .\nOn January 30 came the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Tet Offensive against South Vietnam 's five largest cities , including Saigon and the US embassy there and other government installations .\nWhile the Tet offensive failed militarily , it was a psychological victory , definitively turning American public opinion against the war effort .\nIconically , Walter Cronkite of CBS news , voted the nation 's \" most trusted person \" in February expressed on the air that the conflict was deadlocked and that additional fighting would change nothing .\nJohnson reacted , saying \" If I 've lost Cronkite , I 've lost middle America \" .\nIndeed , demoralization about the war was everywhere ; 26 % then approved of Johnson 's handling of Vietnam ; 63 % disapproved .\nJohnson agreed to increase the troop level by 22,000 , despite a recommendation from the Joint Chiefs for ten times that number , By March 1968 Johnson was secretly desperate for an honorable way out of the war .\nClark Clifford , the new Defense Secretary , described the war as \" a loser \" and proposed to \" cut losses and get out \" .\nOn March 31 Johnson spoke to the nation of \" Steps to Limit the War in Vietnam \" .\nHe then announced an immediate unilateral halt to the bombing of North Vietnam and announced his intention to seek out peace talks anywhere at any time .\nAt the close of his speech he also announced , \" I shall not seek , and I will not accept , the nomination of my party for another term as your President \" .\nIn March Johnson decided to restrict future bombing with the result that 90 percent of North Vietnam 's population and 75 percent of its territory was off-limits to bombing .\nIn April he succeeded in opening discussions of peace talks and after extensive negotiations over the site , Paris was agreed to and talks began in May .\nWhen the talks failed to yield any results the decision was made to resort to private discussions in Paris .\nTwo months later it was apparent that private discussions proved to be no more productive .\nDespite recommendations in August from Harriman , Vance , Clifford and Bundy to halt bombing as an incentive for Hanoi to seriously engage in substantive peace talks , Johnson refused .\nIn October when the parties came close to an agreement on a bombing halt , Republican presidential nominee Richard Nixon intervened with the South Vietnamese , and made promises of better terms , so as to delay a settlement on the issue until after the election .\nAfter the election , Johnson 's primary focus on Vietnam was to get Saigon to join the Paris peace talks .\nIronically , only after Nixon added his urging did they do so .\nEven then they argued about procedural matters until after Nixon took office .\n= = = The Six-Day War and Israel = = =\nIn a 1993 interview for the Johnson Presidential Library oral history archives , Johnson 's Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara stated that a carrier battle group , the U.S . 6th Fleet , sent on a training exercise toward Gibraltar was re-positioned back towards the eastern Mediterranean to be able to assist Israel during the Six-Day War of June 1967 .\nGiven the rapid Israeli advances following their strike on Egypt , the administration \" thought the situation was so tense in Israel that perhaps the Syrians , fearing Israel would attack them , or the Soviets supporting the Syrians might wish to redress the balance of power and might attack Israel \" .\nThe Soviets learned of this course correction and regarded it as an offensive move .\nIn a hotline message from Moscow , Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin said , \" If you want war you 're going to get war . \"\nThe Soviet Union supported its Arab allies .\nIn May 1967 , the Soviets started a surge deployment of their naval forces into the East Mediterranean .\nEarly in the crisis they began to shadow the US and British carriers with destroyers and intelligence collecting vessels .\nThe Soviet naval squadron in the Mediterranean was sufficiently strong to act as a major restraint on the U.S .

Robert F. Kennedy of New York entered the race .\nInternal polling by Johnson 's campaign in Wisconsin , the next state to hold a primary election , showed the President trailing badly .\nJohnson did not leave the White House to campaign .\nBy this time Johnson had lost control of the Democratic Party , which was splitting into four factions , each of which generally disliked the other three .\nThe first consisted of Johnson ( and Humphrey ) , labor unions , and local party bosses ( led by Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley ) .\nThe second group consisted of students and intellectuals who were vociferously against the war and rallied behind McCarthy .\nThe third group were Catholics , Hispanics and African Americans , who rallied behind Robert Kennedy .\nThe fourth group were traditionally segregationist white Southerners , who rallied behind George C. Wallace and the American Independent Party .\nVietnam was one of many issues that splintered the party , and Johnson could see no way to win the war and no way to unite the party long enough for him to win re-election .\nIn addition , although it was not made public at the time , Johnson became more worried about his failing health and was concerned that he might not live through another four-year term .\nIn 1967 , he secretly commissioned an actuarial study that predicted he would die at 64 .\nTherefore , at the end of a speech on March 31 , 1968 , he shocked the nation when he announced he would not run for re-election by concluding with the line : \" I shall not seek , and I will not accept , the nomination of my party for another term as your President . \"\nThe next day , his approval ratings increased from 36 % to 49 % .\nHistorians have debated the factors that led to Johnson 's surprise decision .\nShesol says Johnson wanted out of the White House but also wanted vindication ; when the indicators turned negative he decided to leave .\nGould says that Johnson had neglected the party , was hurting it by his Vietnam policies , and underestimated McCarthy 's strength until the very last minute , when it was too late for Johnson to recover .\nWoods said Johnson realized he needed to leave in order for the nation to heal .\nDallek says that Johnson had no further domestic goals , and realized that his personality had eroded his popularity .\nHis health was not good , and he was preoccupied with the Kennedy campaign ; his wife was pressing for his retirement and his base of support continued to shrink .\nLeaving the race would allow him to pose as a peacemaker .\nBennett , however , says Johnson \" had been forced out of a reelection race in 1968 by outrage over his policy in Southeast Asia . \"\nAfter Robert Kennedy 's assassination , Johnson rallied the party bosses and unions to give Humphrey the nomination at the 1968 Democratic National Convention .\nPersonal correspondences between the President and some in the Republican Party suggested Johnson tacitly supported Nelson Rockefeller 's campaign .\nHe reportedly said that if Rockefeller became the Republican nominee , he would not campaign against him ( and would not campaign for Humphrey ) .\nIn what was termed the October surprise , Johnson announced to the nation on October 31 , 1968 , that he had ordered a complete cessation of \" all air , naval and artillery bombardment of North Vietnam \" , effective November 1 , should the Hanoi Government be willing to negotiate and citing progress with the Paris peace talks .\nIn the end , Democrats did not fully unite behind Humphrey , enabling Republican candidate Richard Nixon to win the election .\n= = = Administration and Cabinet = = =\n= = = Judicial appointments = = =\nJohnson appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States :\n* Abe Fortas1965\n* Thurgood Marshall1967 ( the first African-American )\nJohnson anticipated court challenges to his legislative measures in 1965 , and thought it advantageous to have a \" mole \" in the Supreme Court who he thought could provide him with inside information , as he was able to get from the legislative branch .\nAbe Fortas in particular was the individual that Johnson thought could fill the bill .\nThe opportunity arose when an opening occurred for Ambassador to the UN , with Adlai Stevenson 's death ; Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg accepted Johnson 's offer to transfer to the UN position .\nJohnson insisted on Fortas assuming Goldberg 's seat , over Fortas 's wife 's objection that it was too early in his career .\nMrs. Fortas expressed disapproval to Johnson personally afterwards .\nWhen Earl Warren announced his retirement in 1968 , Johnson nominated Fortas to succeed him as Chief Justice of the United States , and nominated Homer Thornberry to succeed Fortas as Associate Justice .\nHowever , Fortas 's nomination was filibustered by senators , and neither nominee was voted upon by the full Senate .\n= = Post-presidency = =\nAfter leaving the presidency in January 1969 , Johnson went home to his ranch in Stonewall , Texas , accompanied by former aide and speechwriter Harry J. Middleton , who would draft Johnson 's first book , The Choices We Face , and work with him on his memoirs entitled The Vantage Point : Perspectives of the Presidency 1963 \u2013 1969 , published in 1971 .\nThat year , the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum opened on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin .\nHe donated his Texas ranch in his will to the public to form the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park , with the provision that the ranch \" remain a working ranch and not become a sterile relic of the past \" .\nJohnson gave Nixon high grades in foreign policy , but worried that his successor was being pressured into removing U.S. forces too quickly from South Vietnam , before the South Vietnamese were really able to defend themselves .\n\" If the South falls to the Communists , we can have a serious backlash here at home , \" he warned .\nDuring the 1972 presidential election , Johnson endorsed Democratic presidential nominee George S. McGovern , a senator from South Dakota , although McGovern had long opposed Johnson 's foreign and defense policies .\nThe McGovern nomination and presidential platform dismayed him .\nNixon could be defeated \" if only the Democrats don 't go too far left , \" he had insisted .\nJohnson had felt Edmund Muskie would be more likely to defeat Nixon ; however , he declined an invitation to try to stop McGovern receiving the nomination as he felt his unpopularity within the Democratic party was such that anything he said was more likely to help McGovern .\nJohnson 's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 John Connally had served as President Nixon 's Secretary of the Treasury and then stepped down to head \" Democrats for Nixon \" , a group funded by Republicans .\nIt was the first time that Connally and Johnson were on opposite sides of a general election campaign .\nIn March 1970 , Johnson suffered an attack of angina and was taken to Brooke Army General Hospital on Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio .\nHe was urged to lose a considerable amount of weight .\nJohnson had grown dangerously heavier since leaving the White House , gaining more than and weighing around .\nHe had also resumed smoking after nearly 15 years without having done so , which contributed further to his health problems .\nThe following summer , again gripped by chest pains , he embarked on a crash water diet , shedding about in less than a month .\nIn April 1972 , Johnson fell victim to a second heart attack while visiting his daughter , Lynda , in Charlottesville , Virginia .\n\" I 'm hurting real bad , \" he confided to friends .\nThe chest pains hit him nearly every afternoon \u2014 a series of sharp , jolting pains that left him scared and breathless .\nA portable oxygen tank stood next to his bed , and he periodically interrupted what he was doing to lie down and don the mask to gulp air .\nHe continued to smoke heavily , and , although placed on a low-calorie , low-cholesterol diet , kept to it only in fits and starts .\nMeanwhile , he began experiencing severe abdominal pains .\nDoctors diagnosed this problem through X-rays as diverticulosis \u2014 pouches of tissue forming on the intestine .\nHis condition rapidly worsened and surgery was recommended , so Johnson flew to Houston to consult with heart specialist Dr. Michael DeBakey .\nDeBakey discovered that even though two of the former President 's coronary arteries were critically damaged , the overall condition of his heart was so poor that even attempting a bypass surgery would likely result in fatal complications .\n= = Death and funeral = =\nWith Johnson 's heart condition now diagnosed as terminal , he returned home to his ranch outside San Antonio .\nAt approximately 3 : 39pm Central Time on January 22 , 1973 , Johnson suffered a massive heart attack .\nAfter he had placed a call to the Secret Service agents on the ranch , they rushed to the former President 's bedroom .\nThere , they found Johnson still holding the telephone receiver in his hand , unconscious and not breathing .\nJohnson was airlifted in one of his own airplanes to San Antonio and taken to Brooke Army General , where he was pronounced dead on arrival at the facility by cardiologist and Army colonel Dr. George McGranahan .\nHe was 64 years old .\nShortly after Johnson 's death , his press secretary Tom Johnson ( no relation ) telephoned Walter Cronkite at CBS ; Cronkite was live on the air with the CBS Evening News at the time , and a report on Vietnam was cut abruptly while Cronkite was still on the line , so he could break the news .\nJohnson 's death came two days after Richard Nixon 's second inauguration , which followed Nixon 's landslide victory in the 1972 election .\nHis death meant that for the first time since 1933 , when Calvin Coolidge died during Herbert Hoover 's final months in office , that there were no former Presidents still living ; Johnson had been the only living ex-President since December 26 , 1972 , following the death of Harry S. Truman .\nAs of 2018 , Johnson remains the most recent former Democratic President to die .\nJohnson was honored with a state funeral in which Texas Congressman J. J. Pickle and former Secretary of State Dean Rusk eulogized him at the Capitol .\nThe final services took place on January 25 .\nThe funeral was held at the National City Christian Church in Washington , D.C . , where he had often worshiped as president .\nThe service was presided over by President Richard Nixon and attended by foreign dignitaries , led by former Japanese prime minister Eisaku Sat\u014d , who served as Japanese prime minister during Johnson 's presidency .\nEulogies were given by the Rev.\nDr. George Davis , the church 's pastor , and W. Marvin Watson , former postmaster general .\nNixon did not speak , though he attended , as is customary for presidents during state funerals , but the eulogists turned to him and lauded him for his tributes , as Rusk did the day before , as Nixon mentioned Johnson 's death in a speech he gave the day after Johnson died , announcing the peace agreement to end the Vietnam War .\nJohnson was buried in his family cemetery ( which , although it is part of the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park in Stonewall , Texas , is still privately owned by the Johnson family , who have requested that the public not enter the cemetery ) , a few yards from the house in which he was born .\nEulogies were given by former Texas governor John Connally and the Rev.\nBilly Graham , the minister who officiated at the burial rites .\nThe state funeral , the last for a president until Ronald Reagan 's in 2004 , was part of an unexpectedly busy week in Washington , as the Military District of Washington ( MDW ) dealt with its second major task in less than a week , beginning with Nixon 's second inauguration .\nThe inauguration affected the state funeral in various ways , because Johnson died only two days after the inauguration .\nThe MDW and the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee canceled the remainder of the ceremonies surrounding the inauguration , to allow for a full state funeral , and many of the military men who participated in the inauguration took part in the funeral .\nIt also meant Johnson 's casket traveled the entire length of the Capitol , entering through the Senate wing when taken into the rotunda to lie in state and exiting through the House wing steps due to inauguration construction on the East Front steps .\n= = Personality and public image = =\nAccording to biographer Radall Woods , Johnson posed in many different roles .\nDepending on the circumstances , he could be :\nOther historians have noted how he played additional roles , as Kent Germany reports :\nJohnson was often seen as a wildly ambitious , tireless , and imposing figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed .\nHe worked 18- to 20-hour days without break and was apparently absent of any leisure activities .\n\" There was no more powerful majority leader in American history , \" biographer Robert Dallek writes .\nDallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the Senators , knew what their ambitions , hopes , and tastes were and used it to his advantage in securing votes .\nAnother Johnson biographer noted , \" He could get up every day and learn what their fears , their desires , their wishes , their wants were and he could then manipulate , dominate , persuade and cajole them . \"\nAt tall , Johnson had his own particular brand of persuasion , known as \" The Johnson Treatment \" .\nA contemporary writes , \" It was an incredible blend of badgering , cajolery , reminders of past favors , promises of future favors , predictions of gloom if something doesn 't happen .\nWhen that man started to work on you , all of a sudden , you just felt that you were standing under a waterfall and the stuff was pouring on you . \"\nJohnson 's cowboy hat and boots reflected his Texas roots and genuine love of the rural hill country .\nFrom of land that he was given by an aunt in 1951 , he created a working ranch with 400 head of registered Hereford cattle .\nThe National Park Service keeps a herd of Hereford cattle descended from Johnson 's registered herd and maintains the ranch property .\nBiographer Randall Woods argues that Social Gospel themes Johnson learned from childhood allowed him to transform social problems into moral problems .\nThis helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice , as exemplified by the Great Society and his commitment to racial equality .\nThe Social Gospel explicitly inspired his foreign-policy approach to a sort of Christian internationalism and nation building .\nFor example , in a 1966 speech he quoted at length from the Social Creed of the Methodist Church issued in 1940 , adding \" It would be very hard for me to write a more perfect description of the American ideal . \"\n= = Legacy = =\nHistory has viewed Johnson both through the lens of his historic legislative achievements , and his lack of success in the Vietnam War .\nHis overall rating among historians has remained relatively steady over the past 35 years , and his average ranking is higher than any of the eight presidents that followed him , although similar to Reagan and Clinton .\nThe Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston was renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 1973 , and Texas created a legal state holiday to be observed on August 27 to mark Johnson 's birthday .\nIt is known as Lyndon Baines Johnson Day .\nThe Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove on the Potomac was dedicated on April 6 , 1976 .\nThe Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs was named in his honor , as is the Lyndon B. Johnson National Grassland .\nAlso named for him are Lyndon B. Johnson High School in Austin , Lyndon B. Johnson High School in Laredo , Lyndon B. Johnson Middle School in Melbourne , Florida , and Lyndon B. Johnson Elementary School in Jackson , Kentucky .\nInterstate 635 in Dallas , Texas is named the Lyndon B.

        "article":"John Henry Johnson ( November 24 , 1929 \u2013 June 3 , 2011 ) was a gridiron football running back known for his excellence at the fullback position as both a runner and a blocker .\nHis first professional stint was in Canada in the Western Interprovincial Football Union ( WIFU ) for one season with the Calgary Stampeders .\nHe then played in the National Football League ( NFL ) for the San Francisco 49ers , Detroit Lions , and Pittsburgh Steelers before spending his final season in the American Football League ( AFL ) with the Houston Oilers .\nCommonly referred to as simply John Henry , an allusion to the folk hero of the same name , Johnson was a tough and tenacious player who performed at a high level well into the tail end of his career .\nAfter playing college football for St. Mary 's College of California and Arizona State , Johnson was drafted in the second round of the 1953 NFL Draft by the Steelers .\nHe instead played one season of Canadian football for the Stampeders , in which he won the Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy as the league 's most valuable player .\nHe then signed with the 49ers , and played left halfback in San Francisco 's famed \" Million Dollar Backfield \" .\nHe was traded to Detroit in 1957 , and became the team 's leading rusher en route to that year 's NFL championship .\nHis abilities seemingly in decline , Johnson was traded to Pittsburgh in 1960 , where he had the most productive years of his career , recording two 1,000-yard rushing seasons .\nHe remains the oldest player to record a 1,000-yard rushing season as well as the oldest to rush for 200 or more yards in a game .\nA four-time Pro Bowl selection , Johnson ranked third on the NFL 's all-time rushing yards list when he retired , but was best remembered by his peers for the mark he left with his blocking .\nHe was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987 .\n= = Early life and college = =\nJohn Henry Johnson was a native of Waterproof in southern Tensas Parish in northeastern Louisiana .\nHe played high school football in northern California at Pittsburg High School , and college football at Saint Mary 's College of California in Moraga before transferring to Arizona State College in Tempe .\nWhile at Saint Mary 's , sportswriters deemed Johnson \" one of the fleetest and finest players on the Pacific Coast . \"\nAs a senior at Arizona State , he played left halfback and was recognized as one of the roughest and hardest runners in the country , and as one of the top defensive players as a safety .\nHe also excelled as a punt returner , and had a two-game stretch in which he returned four punts for touchdowns .\nJohnson 's running abilities made him a standout pro football prospect as a black athlete at a primarily white college .\n= = Professional career = =\n= = = Canadian football = = =\nSelected in the second round of the 1953 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers , Johnson instead played one season in Canada with the Calgary Stampeders of the Western Interprovincial Football Union ( WIFU ) in 1953 .\nJohnson reasoned that Calgary had offered more money , but Steelers owner Art Rooney speculated that Johnson thought it was too cold in Pittsburgh .\n\" He must have thought he was going to some resort up there , \" joked Rooney .\nHe led the Stampeders in rushing that season with 107 carries for 648 yards , an average of six yards per carry with five touchdowns .\nIn addition , Johnson caught 33 passes for 365 yards and three more touchdowns , returned 47 punts for 386 yards , and had a 104-yard kickoff return touchdown .\nHe also starred on defense and intercepted five passes .\nHe was awarded the Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy as the league 's most valuable player .\nJohnson was also a leading WIFU All-Star vote receiver , but because he played both offense and defense so well voters split their votes and he was left off the team 's \" roster \" .\n= = = American football = = =\n= = = = San Francisco 49ers = = = =\nJohnson was signed by the San Francisco 49ers in 1954 as a halfback , where he joined Hugh McElhenny , Y. A. Tittle , and Joe Perry to form the 49ers ' famed \" Million Dollar Backfield \" .\nThat year , the 49ers shattered the team record for rushing yards in a season .\nJohnson finished second in the league in rushing with 681 yards , behind only Perry , who picked up the majority of his 1,049 yards behind blocking from Johnson .\nJohnson scored nine touchdowns , which were the most for a season in his career .\nHe was invited to his first Pro Bowl following the season , joining Tittle and Perry .\nJohnson earned second-team All-Pro honors from United Press International ( UPI ) and the New York Daily News .\nFor the remainder of his time in San Francisco , Johnson was unable to replicate the success of his rookie year , as his production dropped significantly in the following two seasons .\nHe played in seven games in 1955 before suffering a shoulder injury against the Los Angeles Rams , and finished the year with only 19 carries for 69 yards and one touchdown .\nHe was traded to the Detroit Lions following the 1956 season in exchange for fullback Bill Bowman and defensive back Bill Stits .\n= = = = Detroit Lions = = = =\nLions head coach Buddy Parker saw Johnson 's value as a blocker and moved him to fullback .\nIn his first season with Detroit in 1957 , he led the team in rushing , carrying for 621 yards and five touchdowns .\nIn the 1957 NFL Championship Game , which was won by the Lions 59 \u2013 14 over the Cleveland Browns , Johnson carried seven times for 34 yards , caught a sixteen-yard pass , and recovered a fumble on defense .\nGoing into the 1958 season , the Lions looked to continue their success , and Johnson was expected to be the team 's primary ball carrier .\nHowever , Johnson missed several games due to injuries , and the Lions finished with a 4 \u2013 7 \u2013 1 record and one of the league 's worst rushing offenses .\nIn 1959 , Johnson was suspended indefinitely by the Lions after he missed the team plane back to Detroit following a November 1 blowout loss to the 49ers .\nTo that point , the Lions had a 1 \u2013 5 record , and coach George Wilson used Johnson 's suspension as an opportunity to scold the whole team for its lack of \" desire . \"\nJohnson was ultimately fined $ 1,000 .\nWilson took the brunt of the blame for Detroit 's struggles in 1958 and 1959 , but he questioned the resolve of some of the team 's higher-paid players , including Johnson .\nFollowing the season , Johnson was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers for two draft picks .\n\" That 's all we could get for him , \" explained Wilson .\n= = = = Pittsburgh Steelers = = = =\nThe Steelers finally acquired Johnson in 1960 , after having lost him to the CFL when they drafted him eight years prior .\nHis career rejuvenated , he had his most productive years as a pro while in Pittsburgh .\nIn his first season with the team , he rushed for 621 yards with a 5.3 yards-per-carry average , which included a career-high 87-yard score against the Philadelphia Eagles .\nHe became the first Steelers player to rush for 1,000 yards in a season when he did so in 1962 , and he repeated the feat in 1964 .\nHe made three straight Pro Bowl appearances , and was a second-team All-Pro selection by the AP , UPI , and Newspaper Enterprise Association in 1962 .\nAs of 2017 , he remains the oldest player in NFL history to eclipse 1,000 yards rushing in a season , finishing with 1,048 in 1964 , aged 35 .\nIn a game that season against the Cleveland Browns , then aged 34 , Johnson carried 30 times for 200 yards and scored three touchdowns , out-dueling the great Jim Brown .\nIt was only the ninth 200-yard rushing game in NFL history to that point , and the performance made him the oldest player to reach that mark , a record he still holds .\nJohnson 's effort impressed Steelers president Dan Rooney , who remarked that \" he got almost all the yardage by himself . \"\nAge and injuries caught up to Johnson in 1965 , as he was limited to just three carries for eleven yards .\n= = = = Houston Oilers and retirement = = = =\nAfter playing out his option with the Steelers , in July 1966 Johnson signed as a free agent with the Houston Oilers of the American Football League .\nHe joined the Oilers with the hope of helping the team win an AFL championship .\nHowever , the team finished the season last in the Eastern Division with a record of 3 \u2013 11 .\nJohnson retired after the season at the age of 37 .\nHe completed his NFL career having carried 1,571 times for 6,803 yards and 48 touchdowns , and picked up 1,478 yards on 186 pass receptions for seven more scores .\n= = Playing style = =\nEqually proficient as both a blocker and runner , Johnson was described as \" the perfect NFL fullback \" .\nA talented runner , he ran with power both inside and outside the tackles , and he was as fast as McElhenny and Perry .\nJim Brown called Johnson the greatest running back he had ever seen .\nHe was also a very skilled safety and linebacker on defense .\nDuring a preseason game in 1955 , Johnson hit Chicago Cardinals halfback Charley Trippi so hard that he fractured Trippi 's face in multiple places , leaving him with a smashed nose and concussion and all but ended his career .\n\" Football was like a combat zone , \" said Johnson .\n\" I was always told that you carry the impact to the opponent .\nIf you wait for it , the impact will be on you . \"\nPerhaps the most notable aspect of Johnson 's game was his blocking abilities , for which he received heavy praise .\nHe took pride in it , saying \" It gave me a chance to hit all those people who hit me all the time . \"\nQuarterback Bobby Layne , a teammate of Johnson with both the Lions and Steelers , listed Johnson as one of the one of \" Pro Football 's 11 Meanest Men \" in an article for SPORT magazine in 1964 .\n\" By ' mean , ' I mean vicious , unmanageable , consistently tough , \" said Layne .\n\" I don 't mean dirty . \"\nLayne also called Johnson his \" bodyguard , \" saying \" Half the good runners will get a passer killed if you keep them around long enough .\nBut a quarterback hits the jackpot when he gets a combination runner-blocker like Johnson . \"\n= = Honors = =\nUpon his retirement , Johnson was ranked fourth on pro football 's all-time rushing yards list , behind Jim Brown , Jim Taylor , and his fellow Million Dollar Backfield teammate Perry .\nAs of 2016 , he is fourth on the Steelers franchise all-time rushing yards list , behind Franco Harris , Jerome Bettis , and Willie Parker .\nIn 1987 , he was selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame , and chose Steelers owner Art Rooney as his presenter .\nMany of his contemporaries felt his induction was belated ; he had been eligible for induction for the past fifteen years .\nThe 49ers ' \" Million Dollar Backfield \" is currently the only full-house backfield to have all four of its members enshrined in the Hall of Fame .\nJohnson is a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers Legends team , which honors the franchise 's best players pre-1970 .\nHe was a charter inductee to the San Francisco 49ers Hall of Fame in 2009 .\n= = Personal and later life = =\nIn November 1955 , while on the sick list for the 49ers due to a shoulder injury , Johnson carried two women to safety out of a blazing apartment building in Oakland , California .\nOne of the women was his pregnant wife , Barbara Johnson .\nThe couple divorced in 1959 , and a bench warrant was issued for Johnson after he fell $ 2,360 behind on alimony payments , concurrent with his suspension from the Lions for missing the team plane .\nAfter retiring as a player , he worked for Columbia Gas and later for Warner Communications .\nHe had aspirations of coaching football , but the opportunity never arose .\nJohnson died at age 81 in 2011 in Tracy , California .\nSeveral days later , it was announced that Johnson and his fellow Million Dollar Backfield teammate , Joe Perry , who died six weeks earlier , would have their brains examined by researchers at Boston University , who were studying head injuries in sports .\nBoth men were suspected of suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ) , a disorder linked to repeated brain trauma .\nAccording to his daughter , Johnson could not talk or swallow in the final year of his life and also was in a wheelchair .\nShe told the San Francisco Chronicle that she hoped by donating her father 's brain , it would \" help with a cure . \"\n= = References = =\n= = Further reading = =\n*\n= = External links =

        "article":"Gary Earl Johnson ( born January 1 , 1953 ) is an American businessman , author , and politician .\nHe was the 29th Governor of New Mexico from 1995 to 2003 as a member of the Republican Party .\nHe was also the Libertarian Party nominee for President of the United States in the 2012 and 2016 elections .\nJohnson founded one of New Mexico 's largest construction companies .\nHe entered politics for the first time by running for Governor of New Mexico in 1994 on a low-tax , anti-crime platform , promising a ' common sense business approach ' .\nHe beat incumbent Democratic governor Bruce King by 50 % to 40 % .\nHe cut the 10 % annual growth in the budget , in part due to his use of the gubernatorial veto 200 times during his first six months .\nJohnson sought re-election in 1998 , winning by 55 % to 45 % .\nIn his second term , he concentrated on the issue of school voucher reforms as well as campaigning for cannabis decriminalization .\nDuring his tenure as governor , Johnson adhered to an anti-tax policy , setting state and national records for the number of times he used his veto power : more than the other 49 contemporary governors put together .\nTerm-limited , Johnson retired from front-line politics in 2003 .\nJohnson ran for president in 2012 , initially as a Republican on a libertarian platform emphasizing the United States public debt and a balanced budget , protection of civil liberties , military non-interventionism , replacement of income tax with the FairTax , and opposition to the War on Drugs .\nIn December 2011 , he withdrew his candidacy for the Republican nomination and stood for the Libertarian nomination instead , winning the nomination in May 2012 .\nJohnson received 1.3 million votes ( 1 % ) , more than all other minor candidates combined .\nJohnson ran again in 2016 , once again winning the Libertarian nomination and naming former Republican Governor of Massachusetts William Weld as his running mate .\nJohnson received 4.5 million votes ( roughly 3 % of the total vote ) , which is most for a third party presidential candidate since 1996 and the highest national vote share for a Libertarian candidate in history .\nSince the 2016 presidential election , Johnson has stated he will not run for public office again .\n= = Early life and career = =\nJohnson was born on January 1 , 1953 , in Minot , North Dakota , the son of Lorraine B.\n( n\u00e9e Bostow ) , who worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs , and Earl W. Johnson , a public school teacher .\nIn 1971 , Johnson graduated from Sandia High School in Albuquerque , New Mexico , where he was on the school track team .\nHe attended the University of New Mexico from 1971 to 1975 and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in political science .\nWhile at UNM , he joined the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity .\nIt was there that he met his future wife , Denise \" Dee \" Simms .\nWhile in college , Johnson earned money as a door-to-door handyman .\nHis success in that industry encouraged him to start his own business , Big J Enterprises , in 1976 .\nWhen he started the business , which focused on mechanical contracting , Johnson was its only employee .\nHis firm 's major break came when he received a large contract from Intel 's expansion in Rio Rancho , which increased Big J 's revenue to $ 38 million .\nTo cope with the growth of the company , Johnson enrolled in a time management course at night school , which he credits with making him heavily goal driven .\nHe eventually grew Big J into a multimillion-dollar corporation with over 1,000 employees .\nBy the time he sold the company in 1999 , it was one of New Mexico 's leading construction companies .\n= = Governor of New Mexico = =\n= = = First term = = =\nJohnson entered politics in 1994 with the intention of running for governor and was advised by \" Republican Elders \" to run for the State Legislature instead .\nDespite their advice , Johnson spent $ 500,000 of his own money and entered the race with the intent of bringing a \" common sense business approach \" to the office .\nJohnson 's campaign slogan was \" People before Politics \" .\nHis platform emphasized tax cuts , job creation , state government spending growth restraint , and law and order .\nHe won the Republican nomination , defeating state legislator Richard P. Cheney by 34 % to 33 % , with John Dendahl and former governor David F. Cargo in third and fourth .\nJohnson subsequently won a plurality in the three-way general election , defeating the incumbent Governor Bruce King ( a relatively conservative Democrat ) and the former Lieutenant Governor Roberto Mondrag\u00f3n ( who ran as a Green ) with just under 50 % of the vote .\nJohnson was elected in a nationally Republican year , although party registration in the state of New Mexico at the time was 2-to-1 Democratic .\nAs governor , Johnson followed a strict small-government approach .\nAccording to former New Mexico Republican National Committee member Mickey D. Barnett , \" Any time someone approached him about legislation for some purpose , his first response always was to ask if government should be involved in that to begin with . \"\nHe vetoed 200 of 424 bills passed in his first six months in office \u2014 a national record of 47 % of all legislation \u2014 and used the line-item veto on most remaining bills .\nIn office , Johnson fulfilled his campaign promise to reduce the 10 % annual growth of the state budget .\nIn his first budget , Johnson proposed a wide range of tax cuts , including a repeal of the prescription drug tax , a $ 47 million income tax cut , and a 6-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax cut .\nHowever , of these , only the gasoline tax cut was passed .\nDuring the November 1995 federal government shutdown , he joined 20 other Republican governors who called on the Republican leadership in Congress to stand firm against the Clinton administration in budget negotiations ; in the article reporting on the letter and concomitant news conference he was quoted as calling for eliminating the budget deficit through proportional cuts across the budget .\nAlthough Johnson worked to reduce overall state spending , in his first term he raised education spending by nearly a third .\nWhen drop-out rates and test scores showed little improvement , Johnson changed his tactics and began advocating school vouchers \u2014 a key issue in budget battles of his second term as governor .\n= = = Second term = = =\nIn 1998 , Johnson ran for re-election as governor against Democratic Albuquerque Mayor Martin Ch\u00e1vez .\nIn his campaign , Johnson promised to continue the policies of his first term : improving schools ; cutting state spending , taxes , and bureaucracy ; and frequent use of his veto and line-item veto power .\nFielding a strong Hispanic candidate in a 40 % Hispanic state , the Democrats were expected to oust Johnson , but Johnson won by a margin of 55 % to 45 % , making him the first governor of New Mexico to serve two successive four-year terms after term limits were expanded to two terms in 1991 .\nJohnson made the promotion of a school voucher system a \" hallmark issue \" of his second term .\nIn 1999 , he proposed the first statewide voucher system in America , which would have enrolled 100,000 students in its first year .\nThat year , he vetoed two budgets that failed to include a voucher program and a government shutdown was threatened , but ultimately yielded to Democratic majorities in both houses of the New Mexico Legislature , who opposed the plan .\nJohnson signed the budget , but line-item vetoed a further $ 21 million , or 1 % , from the legislative plan .\nIn 1999 , Johnson became one of the highest-ranking elected officials in the US to advocate the legalization of marijuana .\nSaying the War on Drugs was \" an expensive bust \" , he advocated the decriminalization of marijuana use and concentration on harm-reduction measures for all other illegal drugs .\nHe compared attempts to enforce the nation 's drug laws with the failed attempt at alcohol prohibition .\nIn remarks in 2011 , he noted : \" Half of what government spends on police , courts and prisons is to deal with drug offenders . \"\nHe suggested that drug abuse be treated as a health issue , not as a criminal issue .\nHis approach to the issue garnered supportive notice from conservative icon William F. Buckley , as well as the Cato Institute and Rolling Stone .\nIn 2000 , Johnson proposed a more ambitious voucher program than he had proposed the year before , under which each parent would receive $ 3,500 per child for education at any private or parochial school .\nThe Democrats sought $ 90m extra school funding without school vouchers , and questioned Johnson 's request for more funding for state-run prisons , having opposed his opening of two private prisons .\nNegotiations between the governor and the legislature were contentious , again nearly leading to a government shutdown .\nIn 2000 , New Mexico was devastated by the Cerro Grande Fire .\nJohnson 's handling of the disaster earned him accolades from The Denver Post , which observed that :\nJohnson ..... was all over the Cerro Grande Fire last week .\nHe helped reporters understand where the fire was headed when low-level Forest Service officials couldn 't , ran herd over the bureaucratic process of getting state and federal agencies and the National Guard involved , and even helped put out some of the fire with his feet .\nOn a tour of Los Alamos last Wednesday , when he saw small flames spreading across a lawn , he had his driver stop his car .\nHe jumped out and stomped on the flames , as did his wife and some of his staffers .\nJohnson 's leadership during the fire was praised by Democratic Congressman Tom Udall , who said : \" I think the real test of leadership is when you have circumstances like this .\nHe 's called on his reserves of energy and has just been a really excellent leader under very difficult circumstances here . \"\nJohnson rebuffed efforts by the Libertarian Party to draft him in the 2000 presidential election , stating himself to be a Republican with no interest in running for president .\n= = = Reception = = =\nAccording to anonymous sources , Governor Johnson was known for a lack of interest in policy details and those who worked with Johnson at the time \" recall a chief executive who would speed through meetings and often preferred to discuss his fitness routine than focus on the minutiae of policymaking . \"\nIn his first term , he frequently clashed with the legislature , but in the second term , he \" became more comfortable with the limits of his executive power \" and took a more conciliatory approach .\nCommentator Andrew Sullivan quoted a claim that Johnson \" is highly regarded in the state for his outstanding leadership during two terms as governor .\nHe slashed the size of state government during his term and left the state with a large budget surplus . \"\nIn an interview in Reason magazine in January 2001 , Johnson 's accomplishments in office were described as follows : \" no tax increases in six years , a major road building program , shifting Medicaid to managed care , constructing two new private prisons , canning 1,200 state employees , and vetoing a record number of bills . \"\nAccording to one New Mexico paper , \" Johnson left the state fiscally solid \" and was \" arguably the most popular governor of the decade \u2026 leaving the state with a $ 1 billion budget surplus . \"\nThe Washington Times reported that when Johnson left office , \" the size of state government had been substantially reduced and New Mexico was enjoying a large budget surplus . \"\nAccording to a profile of Johnson in the National Review , \" During his tenure , he vetoed more bills than the other 49 governors combined \u2014 750 in total , one third of which had been introduced by Republican legislators .\nJohnson also used his line-item-veto power thousands of times .\nHe credits his heavy veto pen for eliminating New Mexico 's budget deficit and cutting the growth rate of New Mexico 's government in half . \"\nAccording to the Myrtle Beach Sun News , Johnson \" said his numerous vetoes , only two of which were overridden , stemmed from his philosophy of looking at all things for their cost \u2013 benefit ratio and his axe fell on Republicans as well as Democrats . \"\nWhile in office , Johnson was criticized for opposing funding for an independent study of private prisons after a series of riots and killings at the facilities .\nMartin Chavez , his opponent in the 1998 New Mexico gubernatorial race , criticized Johnson for his frequent vetoing of programs , suggesting that it resulted in New Mexico 's low economic and social standing nationally .\nJournalist Mark Ames described Johnson as \" a hard-core conservative \" who \" ruled the state like a right-wing authoritarian \" and only embraced marijuana legalization in his second term for populist gain .\nThis was mainly in reference to a commercial from Johnson 's reelection campaign featuring Johnson saying that a felon in New Mexico would serve \" every lousy second \" of their prison sentence .\nJohnson insisted , however , that the commercial was directed at \" the guy who 's got his gun out \" rather than nonviolent drug offenders .\n= = = Post governorship = = =\nJohnson was term limited and could not run for a third consecutive term as governor in 2002 .\nIn the 2008 presidential election campaign , Johnson endorsed Ron Paul for the Republican nomination , \" because of his commitment to less government , greater liberty , and lasting prosperity for America . \"\nJohnson spoke at Paul 's \" Rally for the Republic \" on September 2 , 2008 .\nJohnson serves on the Advisory Council of Students for Sensible Drug Policy , a student nonprofit organization which advocates for drug policy reform .\n, he serves on the board of directors of Students For Liberty , a nonprofit libertarian organization .\nHis first book , Seven Principles of Good Government , was published on August 1 , 2012 .\n= = 2012 presidential campaign = =\n= = = Early campaign = = =\nIn 2009 , Johnson began indicating interest in running for president in the 2012 election .\nIn the April 20 , 2009 edition of The American Conservative magazine , Bill Kauffman told readers to \" keep an eye out \" for a Johnson presidential campaign in 2012 , reporting that Johnson had told him that \" he was keeping his options open for 2012 \" and that \" he may take a shot at the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 as an antiwar , anti-Fed , pro-personal liberties , slash-government-spending candidate \u2014 in other words , a Ron Paul libertarian \" .\nDuring a June 24 , 2009 appearance on Fox News 's Freedom Watch , host Judge Andrew Napolitano asked Johnson if he would run for president in 2012 , to which Johnson responded that he thought it would be inappropriate to openly express his desires before President Obama is given the opportunity to prove himself , but he followed up that statement by saying \" it appears personal freedoms are being shoveled out the window more and more . \"\nIn an October 26 , 2009 , interview with the Santa Fe New Mexican 's Steve Terrell , Johnson announced his decision to form an advocacy committee called the Our America Initiative to help him raise funds and promote small government ideas .\nIn December 2009 , Johnson asked strategist Ron Nielson of NSON Opinion Strategy , who has worked with Johnson since 1993 when he ran his successful gubernatorial campaign , to organize the Our American Initiative as a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) committee .\nNielson serves as a senior advisor to Our America Initiative .\nThe stated focus of the organization is to \" speak out on issues regarding topics such as government efficiency , lowering taxes , ending the war on drugs , protecting civil liberties , revitalizing the economy and promoting entrepreneurship and privatization \" .\nThe move prompted speculation among media pundits and Johnson 's supporters that he might be laying the groundwork for a 2012 presidential run .\nThroughout 2010 , Johnson repeatedly deflected questions about a 2012 presidential bid by saying his 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) status prevented him from expressing a desire to run for federal office on politics .\nHowever , he was outspoken about the issues affecting the country , particularly \" the size and cost of government \" and the \" deficits and debt that
